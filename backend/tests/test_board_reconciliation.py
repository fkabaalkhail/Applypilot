"""Board crawling + reconciliation for big boards.

Workday and SmartRecruiters boards used to stop at a fixed page cap, so any
board bigger than 160 (Workday) or 500 (SmartRecruiters) postings came back
partial, was never reconciled, and leaked dead rows into the feed. These tests
pin the fix: whole lists are paged (within a page cap and a per-run deadline),
completeness is proven rather than assumed, partial snapshots still confirm
what they listed, and legacy rows are matched instead of duplicated.
