"""
Application profile endpoint for the Chrome extension.

GET /api/user/application-profile, the canonical, ready-to-fill profile the
extension autofills from. It merges the three places a user's data can live:

    1. ResumeProfileDB, data parsed from the uploaded resume (what the web
                          app's Profile page shows). This is the primary source.
    2. UserSettings, manually-entered form-filling fields + screening answers.
    3. User, account name/email as a final fallback.

The response uses camelCase keys so it maps 1:1 onto the extension's
`UserApplicationProfile` type (see chrome-extension/src/shared/types.ts). Before
this endpoint existed the extension fell back to GET /settings, which a resume
upload never populates, so signed-in users saw an empty profile.
