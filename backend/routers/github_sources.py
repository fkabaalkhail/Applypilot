# cron-poll shares one request with the workflow's `curl --max-time 300` and
# Vercel's 300 s function limit, so every phase is time-boxed from the start
# of the request (a normal run takes 13-27 s, the slowest of 30 in late
# September 127 s):
#   - no new source starts after CRON_POLL_BUDGET_SECONDS, and a source still
#     polling at CRON_POLL_HARD_STOP_SECONDS is cut off (a hung README or
#     probe batch; it is due again next run, the rows it stored are kept);
#   - no description fetch starts after CRON_POLL_ENRICH_UNTIL_SECONDS (each
#     can take its whole 15 s timeout; cron-backfill picks up the rest);
#   - the match-alert sweep is cut off at CRON_POLL_WALL_SECONDS. It banks
#     every score as it buys it, so a cut sweep loses no LLM spend, and it
#     can only be cut at an LLM await, never between an email send and the
#     record of it.
# A cut lands only at an await, so synchronous work runs past it:
#   - a source's insert loop (poll_source stores rows with no await once
#     its probes are done). A source whose probes end just before the hard
#     stop stores its whole batch after it, ~20 s for a 375-row file at
#     prod's insert rate, and then finishes its poll: past
#     CRON_POLL_ENRICH_UNTIL_SECONDS its description fetch starts nothing,
#     so no await is left to cut it at.
#   - the list dedup passes below (column-only: one read of the visible list
#     rows, a few thousand, plus an UPDATE per hidden group; 0.2 s over
#     1,824 rows locally, a few Neon round trips in prod).
#   - the rest of the sweep once it has stopped scoring (llm_unavailable,
#     as while OpenAI billing is off, or its scoring budget spent): no await
#     is left, so every remaining user's queries and cached-match email
#     sends run to completion, each send up to the Resend SDK's 30 s
#     timeout.
# At today's scale (5 eligible users, a 25-user cap) the worst run ends
# around 225-265 s, under the 300 s ceiling. Only sends that hang to their
# timeout, or many more alert users while scoring is off, could pass it:
# the wall clock cannot cut either.
