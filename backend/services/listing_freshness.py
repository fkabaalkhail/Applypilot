"""
Listing freshness: the lifecycle layer that keeps the catalogue honest.

Aggregator competitors' known weakness is ghost/expired listings, jobs that
died on the employer's board weeks ago but keep ranking. This module makes the
catalogue self-correcting:

  - every board crawl RECONCILES its own rows: still-listed rows get
    ``last_seen_at`` bumped (and revived if previously removed), vanished rows
    are marked ``removed`` the same hour, not on some future full sweep
  - rows a board stopped vouching for (partial crawls, broken boards) go
    ``stale`` after STALE_AFTER_HOURS, and a time-boxed per-run budget of
    rows gets checked against the platform's own API (services/
    platform_liveness.py): dead → removed, alive → revived, anything
    inconclusive only stamps ``last_probed_at``
  - aggregator rows (LinkedIn/Indeed/GitHub lists), which no board will ever
    re-confirm, EXPIRE by age; stale rows nothing vouches for, and rows on
    boards we can't reconcile, age out too
  - active rows carry a ``ghost_risk_score`` heuristic, surfaced as data,
    never silently filtered, so the product decides hide vs badge

``last_seen_at`` is positive evidence only (a board listed the row, or the
platform's API said the posting is open). A probe that learned nothing
stamps ``last_probed_at`` instead, so it can never pass for a confirmation;
a check that got no answer at all (never sent, or rate-limited) stamps
nothing, so the row keeps its place in line.

All states are soft: rows are never deleted (saved-job and application records
reference them), and the row's user-facing ``status`` workflow is untouched.
Everything here is column-query based, descriptions are only read for the
one-time evergreen check, because a whole-row sweep over the catalogue is
exactly the egress mistake that melted the Neon budget once already.
