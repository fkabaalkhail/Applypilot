"""
Platform-aware listing liveness: is this posting still open?

A plain GET can't answer that for most of the catalogue. Workday serves the
same ~6.5 KB app shell (HTTP 200) for live, closed and made-up job ids;
SmartRecruiters' careers links 302 to the company careers home either way;
Ashby and Oracle HCM pages are SPAs. So every known ATS is asked through its
own public API, which answers honestly both ways, and only unknown hosts fall
back to the page itself, where a death signal (404/410, a redirect to an
error page, a "no longer available" message in the VISIBLE text) is trusted
but a bare 200 proves nothing.

Three verdicts:
  - ``dead``: the platform (or an honest page) says the posting is gone
  - ``alive``: the posting is open. ``authoritative`` only when the
    platform's own API/board said so, the one case allowed to revive a row
  - ``unknown``: bot walls (401/403/429/999), network noise, SPA shells,
    anything inconclusive. Never evidence either way.

The one 403 read as death is Workday's CXS JSON ``errorCode: "S22"``, an
API-level "posting unpublished" signal (85/85 agreement with a board search
by requisition id); a bot wall never answers with that JSON.

A result that learned nothing because no answer came back (the host was
skipped, the run's budget for it was spent, the check never got its turn,
or the host rate-limited us) says so in its reason (``DEFERRED_REASONS``),
so callers can leave the row's place in line alone instead of recording a
probe that never happened.
