          <h2>1. Introduction &amp; scope</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[Company Name]</strong> collects, uses,
            discloses, and protects personal information when you use <strong>[App Name]</strong> and
            any related websites, browser extensions, and services (together, the “Service”).
          </p>
          <p>
            We designed this policy for a worldwide audience. Depending on where you live,
            additional rights and protections may apply — including under Quebec’s <em>Act
            respecting the protection of personal information in the private sector</em> (as
            amended by Law 25), Canada’s PIPEDA, the EU/EEA and UK General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR / UK GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by
            the CPRA (CCPA/CPRA). Where a specific law grants you stronger rights than
            described here, that law governs. This policy is adaptable to the laws of
            [Jurisdiction] and other regions where applicable privacy laws apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this
            policy. If you do not agree with it, please do not use the Service.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="controller">
          <h2>2. Who we are &amp; how to reach us</h2>
          <p>
            The organization responsible for your personal information (the “data
            controller,” or under Quebec law the entity accountable for the information) is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Company:</strong> [Company Name]</li>
            <li><strong>Person in charge of personal information / Privacy Officer:</strong> [Privacy Officer Name]</li>

          <p>
            You may contact our Privacy Officer at any time using the details above to ask
            questions, exercise your rights, or make a complaint.

        <section id="collect">
          <h2>3. Personal information we collect</h2>
          <p>We collect the following categories of personal information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity &amp; contact data</strong> — name, email address, phone number, links you provide (e.g., LinkedIn, personal website).</li>
            <li><strong>Profile &amp; job-search data</strong> — résumé/CV content, work history, education, skills, job titles, preferred locations, work authorization, remote preferences, and answers you save to reuse on applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Account &amp; authentication data</strong> — credentials, session tokens, and connected-device records.</li>
            <li><strong>Application &amp; activity data</strong> — jobs you view, applications you submit or track, and how you interact with the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Device, usage &amp; log data</strong> — see Section 9.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment &amp; subscription data</strong> — where applicable (see Section 12).</li>
            <li><strong>Communications</strong> — messages, feedback, and support requests you send us.</li>
            <li><strong>Location data</strong> — where applicable (see Section 10).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not intentionally collect special-category or sensitive information (such
            as health, race, or religious data) except where you voluntarily include it in a
            résumé or application answer, or where you provide demographic
            self-identification for equal-opportunity forms. Where such information is subject
            to heightened protection, we handle it accordingly and, where required, with your
            explicit consent.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="sources">
          <h2>4. How we collect it</h2>
          <p>We obtain personal information in three main ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Directly from you</strong> — when you create an account, upload a résumé, complete your profile, save application answers, contact support, or otherwise use the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatically through the app</strong> — through cookies, similar technologies, and server logs when you use our website, app, or browser extension (see Sections 7 and 9).</li>
            <li><strong>From third-party services</strong> — such as authentication providers, payment processors, analytics providers, and job-board or application-tracking systems you interact with through the Service ([Third-Party Services]).</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="why">
          <h2>5. Why we use your information</h2>
          <p>We use personal information to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain the Service, including creating and managing your account.</li>
            <li>Tailor résumés, generate cover letters, match you with jobs, and auto-fill applications on your behalf.</li>
            <li>Personalize your experience and remember your preferences and saved answers.</li>
            <li>Process payments and manage subscriptions, where applicable.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you, including service messages, product updates, and support responses.</li>
            <li>Send notifications, alerts, and emails you have enabled.</li>
            <li>Monitor, secure, debug, and improve the Service, including analytics and crash diagnostics.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, and respond to fraud, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>

        </section>

        <section id="legal-basis">
          <h2>6. Legal bases for processing</h2>
          <p>
            Where the GDPR, UK GDPR, Quebec law, or similar frameworks apply, we rely on one
            or more of the following legal bases:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> — e.g., for optional analytics, marketing communications, and processing you specifically authorize. You may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> — to deliver the Service you sign up for.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — to secure, improve, and operate the Service, provided these interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and lawful requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Other applicable bases</strong> — such as protecting vital interests or establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims, where relevant.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="cookies">
          <h2>7. Cookies, analytics, SDKs, advertising &amp; tracking technologies</h2>
          <p>
            We and our providers use cookies, local storage, software development kits
            (SDKs), and similar technologies to keep you signed in, remember preferences,
            measure usage, and improve the Service. These may include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Strictly necessary</strong> — required for authentication, security, and core functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics &amp; performance</strong> — to understand how the Service is used ([Third-Party Services]).</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising</strong> — only where applicable; we do not sell your personal information for advertising except as described in Section 21.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Where required by law, we request your consent before setting non-essential
            cookies and let you manage your preferences. You can also control cookies through
            your browser settings.

        <section id="account">
          <h2>8. Account registration &amp; authentication data</h2>
          <p>
            To use the Service you create an account. We process your credentials,
            authentication tokens, and connected-device/session records to sign you in, keep
            your session secure, and let you review and revoke active sessions. We never store
            your password in plain text.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="device">
          <h2>9. Device data, usage data, log data &amp; crash reports</h2>
          <p>
            When you use the Service, we automatically collect technical information such as
            device and browser type, operating system, IP address, approximate region derived
            from IP, timestamps, referring pages, actions taken, and error/crash diagnostics.
            We use this data to operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve the Service.

        <section id="location">
          <h2>10. Location data</h2>
          <p>
            We may infer your approximate location from your IP address to provide relevant
            job matches and for security. We do not collect precise GPS location unless you
            explicitly grant permission, and you can disable this at any time in your device
            settings.

        <section id="comms">
          <h2>11. Push notifications, email &amp; in-app communications</h2>
          <p>
            With your permission, we send push notifications, emails, and in-app messages —
            for example, job alerts, application updates, and account notices. You can opt out
            of non-essential communications at any time via your account settings, the
            unsubscribe link in emails, or your device settings. We may still send essential
            service and security messages.

        <section id="payments">
          <h2>12. Payments, subscriptions &amp; billing</h2>
          <p>
            Where the Service offers paid plans, payments are processed by third-party payment
            providers ([Third-Party Services]). We receive limited billing information (such as
            plan, transaction status, and the last digits of your card) but do not store full
            payment-card numbers on our servers. Your payment data is handled according to the
            payment provider’s privacy policy.

        <section id="ai">
          <h2>13. AI features, automation &amp; external API integrations</h2>
          <p>
            The Service uses artificial-intelligence features to tailor résumés, generate
            cover letters, answer application questions, and auto-fill forms. To provide these
            features, relevant content you supply (such as résumé text and job descriptions)
            may be processed by AI models and external APIs ([Third-Party Services]). We limit
            what is shared to what is needed to perform the requested task. Automated
            processing that produces meaningful output about you is done to deliver features
            you request; where required by law, you can ask for human review of, or object to,
            solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.

            We may store and process personal information in [Hosting Country] and other
            countries where we or our providers operate ([Data Transfer Countries]). This means
            your information may be transferred outside Quebec, the rest of Canada, the EEA, the
            UK, or your home region. When we transfer personal information across borders, we
            use appropriate safeguards required by applicable law — such as the European
            Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, the UK International Data Transfer
            Agreement/Addendum, adequacy decisions, or, for Quebec, a privacy impact assessment
            confirming adequate protection. Contact us for more information about these

            We keep personal information only as long as necessary for the purposes described
            in this policy, to provide the Service, to comply with legal, accounting, or
            reporting obligations, and to resolve disputes. When information is no longer
            needed, we securely delete, destroy, or anonymize it. You can ask us to delete your

          <p>
            We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect
            personal information — including encryption in transit, access controls, and secure
            authentication. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure, so we
            cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work to protect your information and to

          <p>
            If you are in the EEA or the UK, you have the rights listed in Section 18, and you
            may exercise them free of charge in most cases. Our legal bases are described in
            Section 6. You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory
            authority (for example, your national data protection authority in the EEA, or the
            Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK). Where we transfer data outside the
            EEA/UK, we rely on the safeguards in Section 15.
