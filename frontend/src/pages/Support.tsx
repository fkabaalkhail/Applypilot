        <h2>Contact us</h2>
        <p>
          Email <a href="mailto:support@tailrd.ca">support@tailrd.ca</a> and include, if you
          can, the page you were on (a link to the job posting helps enormously) and what you
          expected to happen. Screenshots are gold.
        </p>

        <h2>Quick fixes for common issues</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The panel doesn&rsquo;t appear on a job application.</strong> Click the
            Tailrd icon in the Chrome toolbar to open it, and make sure you&rsquo;re on the
            application form itself (not the job description page).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>&ldquo;Connect your Tailrd account&rdquo; keeps showing.</strong> Sign in
            at <a href="https://www.tailrd.ca">www.tailrd.ca</a> first, then press Connect in
            the panel again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Some fields were left blank.</strong> That&rsquo;s deliberate: Tailrd only
            fills answers it can ground in your profile and never guesses. Add the missing
            details under <em>Your Autofill Information</em> in the panel and run Autofill
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>An outdated résumé got attached.</strong> Edits made in the web app are
            picked up automatically; if something looks stale, reopen the panel so it re-syncs,
            then re-attach.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anything else acting oddly.</strong> Reload the page, or toggle the
            extension off and on at <code>chrome://extensions</code> — then tell us about it
            so we can fix the root cause.
          </li>
        </ul>
