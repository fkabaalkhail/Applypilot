 * The geometry is a least-squares vector fit to the existing artwork

 * 0.99 for the lettering), normalised to a 48 x 48 box with the ring centred at

 * them, and src/__tests__/brand-logo.test.tsx pins them so a change is always
 * deliberate. Keep this file free of imports so the build script can load it.
