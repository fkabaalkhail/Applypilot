# Round 5: the open bugs, Ashby's Yes/No, two new question banks (2026-10-08, night)

Branch `night/autofill-round5` (worktree `.worktrees/autofill-round5`),
from main at 0992cd4 (round 4 and the phase 1 wording). Local only: NOT
pushed, NOT deployed, nothing uploaded. Nothing was submitted anywhere:
every live run blocks non-GET requests (GraphQL queries aside), and no
account was created on a real site.

The biggest find: **no Yes/No question on any Ashby form had ever been
answered.** Ashby draws them as two buttons over a hidden checkbox, and the
scanner saw only the checkbox, labelled "No". Work right, sponsorship,
relocation, office days, U.S. person: blank on every Ashby application
until tonight.

## 1. Real users first

Prod `autofill_reports` (read-only SELECT, branch main): **no reports since
2026-10-05.** The newest is still 2026-10-03 15:15 UTC (checked at the
start of the night and again at 06:25). Prod `security_events` shows no
extension sign-in since 2026-09-28, and none rejected. So P0 had no new
real fills to turn into cases; the night went to round 4's open bugs and
new ground.

## 2. The open bugs from round 4

| bug | cause | now | verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a. Ashby's second school "Field no longer found" (Superhuman) | While a school typeahead is open, Floating UI marks every other field block `aria-hidden` (with `data-aria-hidden`); a rescan then saw 12 of 25 fields | The library's marks are not hiding. A dropdown whose control has gone is looked up again after the page settles | live: menu open, 25 fields stay 25 (old build: 12) |
| b. Workable Saalex freeze: does a person changing the State freeze it too? | | No. Three runs (a person alone; the extension, then a person, twice), each changing the State twice after the dates were in: no freeze | live probe |
| c. Workable's Address from the visitor's IP | Workable's form JSON serves its guess with `prefilledByLocation: true`, and the fill never overwrites a value | A box still holding exactly the guess is empty to the fill and gets the profile's location; a box the person changed is theirs | live, both ways; 20 Workable pins now read the persona's location |
| d. Paylocity's State, and "How did you hear" reported "No option matches" | State: a click only focuses the search box; ArrowDown or typing opens a virtualized list of role-less rows of state codes. The radio: choosing an option replaces its element | Role-less rows are read and a state is searched by its code; a named radio group is read again when one of its radios has left | live: State TX, "2 steps filled (19 ok)" (was 17 ok, 2 need attention) |
| e. Dayforce's Preferred Contact Method | went to the AI | the email the application gives, when the list offers it | live, pinned. Start dates stay blank (decision 28, month-only dates) |
| f. BambooHR Armstrong; Bosch and ServiceNow on SmartRecruiters | Armstrong loaded and passed all four cases (59/59): round 4's misses were the page. SmartRecruiters challenges every page after the first from this machine | Armstrong stays; Bosch retired so the suite's one SmartRecruiters page can pass first | live |

Found on the way: **today's date in the box's own format.** Saalex's date
boxes show DD/MM/YYYY (an en-GB browser): 8 October went in as 10 August,
and round 4's pins had let 10 May stand for 5 October. Today is now
re-emitted in each box's format, and pins check it against the run's date
(`{ today: "DD/MM/YYYY" }`).

## 3. New ground: two question banks, then their pages live

Round 4's method: blind run first, every answer read, a failing test
before each fix, every bank re-run after each fix and every changed answer
read, then the bank's own pages live.

| bank | source (GET only) | postings | questions | answers read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ashby | the public posting API lists a board's jobs; each form from the page's own `ApiJobPosting` GraphQL query (never a mutation) | 69 (the Ashby boards in prod `scraped_jobs`) | 818 | 4,908 |
| Lever | the public postings API; each posting's own `/apply` page as served | 55 (the 52 Lever boards in prod) | 1,122 | 6,732 |

With round 4's four banks: six banks, 47,418 answers, all re-run after
every fix tonight. New tools: `tools/qbank-ashby.mjs`,
`tools/qbank-lever.mjs`, `tools/qbank-diff.cjs` (every answer that changed
between two runs).

Then each bank's own pages live, each posting with the persona one of its
questions got wrong: 13 Ashby postings (`r5a-*`) and 13 Lever postings
(`r5b-*`), every write read, then pinned (150 and 230 checks).
The live runs found what the banks could not:

- **Ashby's Yes/No buttons** (above), and **a form's later sections**
  dropped when every field the scanner recognizes sits in the first one
  (TensorWave: both Yes/No questions cut off as "outside the form").
- **Long Lever questions lost their label**: a question with its
  description, or a paragraph long, ran past 300 characters and was named
  by its input (`surveysResponses[…][field3]`), so no rule saw it.
- **Lever's company** is only in its header logo's alt; unknown, the
  company's own careers-site option ("Palantir Website") was not its own.

Not built: a **Jobvite** bank (its apply page loads the form by XHR from
an API that needs a browser capture first; prod has 3 live Jobvite
postings) and a **SmartRecruiters** bank (the posting page and its API sit
behind the bot challenge from this machine).

**iCIMS and SuccessFactors, the families seen least** (P2), on 11 open
postings (`r5c-*` in `real-live-round5.mjs`, no pins, up to two next
pages): **none reached an application form, and nothing was written.**
Each started on the posting's own job page, as a user arriving from Tailrd
would. On all eight iCIMS pages and both L3Harris (SuccessFactors) pages the
panel had to be opened by hand, found no field, and never opened the
application; on Acuity (SuccessFactors, in French) it clicked "Postuler
maintenant" and reached SuccessFactors' email gate ("Saisir le courriel
pour démarrer le processus"), which needs an account (none created).
(Each run waited out its three minutes: the harness records the flow's last
message only when it begins "Step", "Done" or "Autofill flow stopped", so a
stop such as "No application form found on this page" looked like a hang.
Being checked with the page logs after the final regression.)

## 5. Blanks now answered

- **Every Yes/No question on Ashby**, and Ashby's later form sections.
- Places: "Where are you currently located?"; "Where do you currently live?"
  over states and countries (Squarespace); "Country - Region" lists
  (Dropbox, Intercom; never "US - Washington, D.C" for Washington state);
  a "not listed" option when neither state nor country is listed; a state
  list in the label (Kobie); "able to be located in Jacksonville, FL" for
  movers (RF Smart); Artera's live-there / move / neither.
- "Current or most recent employer", "Where have you most recently
  worked?" (a job that has ended); visa status lists by the applicant's own
  visa (Base Power, Vital Lyfe, OnePay, Doximity; Waymo's for an OPT
  holder).
- Enrollment at a named place for someone enrolled nowhere: "Are you
  currently attending a college or university in the US?" (Superhuman),
  "…a university in Canada?" (Lyft): No for graduates.
- How you heard: "Where did you first see this position?", "How'd you
  hear…", "From which job site did you see this posting?" (Data Lab).
- Employers: "filed an application with us before?", "previous employee of
  any of the Crest family of companies", "Do you currently work for
  Gopuff?", Copper River's "Family of Companies".
- Start dates: "On what date would you be available to work"; "require
  sponorship" (sic) is sponsorship.
- EEO: "I am not a U.S. veteran" (Gopuff); "Caucasian" (AltaML); "Cisgender
  Woman" / "Transgender Man" options (AltaML); race lists named only by
  their options (Wattpad, Faire, Doximity); "racialized person" (eqbank);
  Wattpad's minority list.
- Sponsorship details for those who need sponsorship (Immuta, Calm).
- Kobie's attention check by place ("select the SECOND option"), its
  periodic travel for someone who prefers remote work, Canonical's yearly
  meetups for the same.
- Dayforce's Preferred Contact Method.

## 6. Decisions (one rule each, each easy to reverse)

29. An open menu's "hide others" marks (`data-aria-hidden`) never hide a
    field.
30. A box still showing exactly the page's location guess (Workable's
    `prefilledByLocation`) is empty to the fill.
31. Today's date is written in the box's own format; with none shown,
    month first.
32. A bare salary figure is in the applicant's own currency.
33. A form's later sections of the same kind are part of the form.
34. A school's kind is part of its name ("University of X" is not "X
    College"); a school listed only per campus is never "not listed", and
    the campus is the applicant's.
35. Needing an accommodation (interview or workplace) is No only for
    someone who states no disability; anyone else answers it, never the AI.
36. A visible minority ("racialized person") is any stated race but White;
    Indigenous peoples and two or more races are not decided; "not a
    minority" is never chosen beside "nonvisible minority" for someone
    LGBTQ+ or with a disability.
37. A grouped ethnicity list ("White: Irish") takes the stated group's "any
    other" option, never a subgroup nobody stated.
38. A gender list with cis / trans options takes both stated facts only
    when the stated gender is not offered plain ("Male" beside "Transgender
    Male" is "Male").
39. A first-person statement of awareness over Yes / No is Yes, unless it
    also promises something.
40. Where one will work from is not where one lives now; on site at a place
    nobody named, for someone who will not move, is theirs.
41. Paying for one's own housing or move is the applicant's to answer, like
    relocation assistance.
42. Who completed the application, or whether an AI helped: never answered,
    never sent to the AI (round 4's decision 6, now on the device).
43. Kept: No to non-competes (your day-session decision 1, "unencumbered"),
    also where "other restrictive covenants" are named. This sits uneasily
    with decision 27 (NDAs are common); say if those should be yours.
44. A graduation term in winter is never chosen from the year alone (an
    April 2027 graduate is not "Winter 2027").
45. "Pursuing a degree in X or a related field": a degree in progress
    outside the sciences and engineering is the applicant's to judge.
46. Working for a partner, vendor, client or competitor of the company is
    not working for the company.
47. A visa a country's citizens may use ("TN (Applicable for citizens of
    Canada or Mexico)") is not the citizen's status; an option that names
    the applicant by citizenship ("Canadian or Mexican Citizen (TN Visa)")
    is.
48. Someone enrolled nowhere is not enrolled at a named place; where a
    student's school is, the profile does not say, so that stays theirs.
49. Kept (an earlier round's rule, newly visible on Ashby's Yes/No): a
    posting's own requirement is accepted by applying unless the profile
    refuses it: relocating to New York for Ramp's internship, on site in
    Rochester for MegaZone, travel as needed for NPX, all Yes for a profile
    that says nothing about moving. An open-ended "Are you open to
    relocation?" stays blank without a stated answer. Say if a silent
    profile should leave requirements blank too.
50. A web component's own `label` attribute names its field when nothing
    else does (SmartRecruiters' `<spl-input label="First name">`).

## 7. Regression

Every pinned live case (201), in 16 batches of 13, headful, on the build of
c144207 (04:48): **168 passed, 33 failed.** Every failure was read:

| cause | cases | what now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the posting closed (Greenhouse's job API 404: Robinhood x3, OneImaging x2, D2L, Duolingo; Ashby's API no longer lists it: Greenboard, NTT Data; Pinpoint redirects home: IDT; JazzHR 410 Gone: Directors Investment Group) | 11 (8 postings) | retired, each with a comment saying why |
| the git-ignored sample PDF was missing from the worktree | 1 | copied in; passes |
| answers the cases never had: Ashby's Yes/No questions, Lever survey questions now labelled, Workable's Address now the profile's | 11 | each read against its persona, then pinned |
| wrong answers | 7 (5 bugs) | fixed, a failing test first: both of Superhuman's education rows took Concordia; Waymo's "If yes, what kind?" took TN; Ramp's degree question (3 cases); Grow Therapy's winter term; The Exploration Company's own housing |
| the page changed: Astranis reworded its SMS consent | 1 | re-pinned (still No) |
| Databricks' Degree dropdown did not open once | 1 | passed on re-run (25/25) |
| SmartRecruiters ServiceNow read every label as its id; City stayed blank | 1 | fallback added, not verified live (section 8) |

(Grow Therapy also renamed its custom fields' ids and Waymo's phone widget
stopped adding +1: both re-pinned.)

Then, on the final build, every failing case still open, every round-5
page and every new pin, re-run in six runs of 13 or fewer (r5re-A..F) and
read: **46 distinct pinned cases, every one passing** once its new answers
were read and pinned (the 13 round-5 Ashby pages, 12 of the 13 Lever pages,
and the 21 regression failures still open, all but ServiceNow).

**The final regression, on the final build** (190 pinned cases after the
retirements, 15 batches of 13, started 07:41): running as this is written;
its result replaces this paragraph when it ends.

## 8. Needs you / needs manual verification

**Your decisions**
1. **Upload 0.5.0?** Still not uploaded (I uploaded nothing). The zip
   predates round 5: a release with tonight's fixes needs a new zip.
2. **`EXTENSION_ALLOWED_IDS` on Vercel** (both ids): I did not check or
   change any Vercel setting.
3. **Legal waivers.** Still the lone-acknowledgement rule: National
   Journal's terms (with an at-will clause and a liability release) are
   now Yes by it. Say if lone waivers should stay blank everywhere.
4. **Does OpenAI work now?** Nothing used it tonight; what is left to the
   AI (essays, "May we contact your employer?", Barnes' degree types)
   stays blank while it is down.
5. **Two committed Workable page fixtures** (`test/fixtures/real/workable/
   workable-financeit-ds.html`, `workable-mindex-coop.html`, from an
   earlier round) hold the Address Workable guessed for this machine.
   Scrub them? History keeps it either way.
6. **A bare salary figure is the home currency** (decision 32): a Toronto
   resident's "95000" is CAD. Right?
7. The brief's first P3 item was cut off ("…ng edits"): tell me what it was.
8. **A posting's requirements for a profile that says nothing** (decision
   49): relocating for Ramp's internship, on site in Rochester, travel as
   needed are Yes unless the profile refuses them. Keep that, or leave them
   blank until the profile says?

**Not verified live, or still open**
- **ServiceNow on SmartRecruiters** (the suite's one SmartRecruiters
  page): the fix that reads a web component's own `label` attribute
  (1161e4b) is unit-tested, and the test reproduces the regression's ids
  exactly, but it is not verified live. SmartRecruiters served a DataDome
  CAPTCHA to both follow-up probes from this machine. After a quiet spell,
  run `live-sr-servicenow` alone (it must be the first SmartRecruiters page
  of the session) and check that City is filled.
- **Wattpad's location typeahead and Databricks' Degree dropdown** each
  missed once tonight and passed on every other run: page timing, most
  likely. Watch them in the next regression.
- **Waymo's phone widget** stopped adding +1 tonight; the pin now accepts
  either form. The value written is the same as before.
- **OneImaging's embed host page** (`real-live-embedded.mjs`) has no open
  posting to frame; Waymo still runs a live Greenhouse embed. Point it at
  an open posting to restore the second embed case.
- **Not built:** Jobvite and SmartRecruiters question banks (section 3).
  **Not explored:** Taleo (no active Taleo posting in prod `scraped_jobs`
  tonight).
- **Batch C** (iCIMS, SuccessFactors): why each flow stopped where it did
  (section 3), from the page logs.

# Round 4: real users first, then new ground (2026-10-04, night)

Branch `night/autofill-round4`, from main at 775ff09. Local only: NOT pushed,
NOT deployed. Nothing was submitted anywhere: every live run blocks non-GET
requests (GraphQL queries aside), and no account was created on a real site.

## 1. Can Web Store users connect? And a release to upload

**Connecting.** I could not read the Vercel setting myself (the Vercel
connector answers 403 for the team that owns the `resumate` project), so I
checked what the setting does instead. Prod `security_events` shows completed
extension handshakes from the **Store** id (`dadbhjlflnljgailcpgehdainjdmjeej`)
on 2026-07-14, 08-07, 09-14 and 09-28, and no rejected redirect since
2026-06-27. Store installs can connect today. Please still look at
`EXTENSION_ALLOWED_IDS` on the dashboard (it should hold both ids,
`apgogjfdpleeajnngkfkfekbddcpodkl,dadbhjlflnljgailcpgehdainjdmjeej`); I did
not change any Vercel setting.

**Release 0.5.0, ready to upload (I did not upload it).** The Store still
serves 0.4.0 from July 15 (3 users), and every real fill in prod telemetry
since then ran on it. `chrome-extension/tailrd-extension-0.5.0.zip`, built
from commit 31a4371 after everything in section 8 (231 KB; checked: 8 files, no dev URLs, no key). What to do, the release notes and two listing lines that
are now out of date are in `docs/store-submission.md` ("Release 0.5.0").

**Real fills since 2026-10-04:** none in prod `autofill_reports`. The last
real ones (2026-09-28, 10-03) ran the July build; what they got wrong was
re-run on the current build first (batch R below).

## 2. How it was measured

Each batch was run blind on the build before its fixes, every write read with
`tools/review.cjs`, then fixed, re-run live and pinned.

| batch | pages | blind run: wrong values | after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R: the real users' pages (Greenhouse embeds) | 4 | 1, on 1 page (Waymo) | 0; pinned |
| 1: SmartRecruiters, JazzHR, Breezy, Workable | 5 usable (SmartRecruiters' DataDome blocks every page after the first) | 8, all on the JazzHR page | 0; pinned |
| 2: Greenhouse, 13 companies on their own career sites | 13 | 5, on 4 pages | 0; pinned |

Then a **question bank**: the public Greenhouse API serves every posting's
questions, so 80 postings (806 distinct questions) were rendered as forms and
answered for six personas at once (`test/qbank.test.ts`, opt-in with `QBANK`).
Reading 4,800 answers that way found far more than live pages could: about 40
wrong answers, each fixed with a test. It is code-level (no live widget), so
anything it found was also checked by a unit test and, where the page was in a
batch, live.

New personas (synthetic, `test/e2e/profiles.mjs`): a US worker on H-1B, one on
STEM OPT, a bootcamp graduate with a career gap and a disability, a Berlin
engineer (German Diplom, transgender, bisexual), and an Indian new graduate.

## 3. Wrong answers fixed

Live pages (the value written, and now):

| page | question | wrote | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Waymo (real-user page) | Do you require work authorization? (Canadian, US job) | No | Yes |

| JazzHR | second Institution Name and Major | the first school's | the second school's |
| JazzHR | second Employer Name | the current employer | the previous one |
| JazzHR | each employer's Address (x2) | the applicant's street | blank |
| JazzHR | each school's Location (x2) | the applicant's city | blank |
| Duolingo | "After the OPT, eligible for a 24-month OPT extension?" (US citizen) | Yes | No |
| Duolingo | Alternate Email | the same email | blank |
| Coveo | member of the 2SLGBTQI+ community? (bisexual, transgender) | Prefer not to say | Yes / Oui |
| Cloudflare | Legal Name (if different than above) | the same name | blank |
| Accenture Federal | Degree, the high-school row | Technical Diploma | High School Diploma/GED |

Question bank (each also a unit test):

| company | question | wrote | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sony Music, DoorDash | "…require sponsorship (e.g., H-1B, E-3, TN, O-1, STEM OPT…)?" for applicants needing it | No | Yes |
| Toast | "Do you now, or will you ever, require sponsorship?" (OPT) | No | Yes |
| Datadog | authorized to work here? (Berlin, India) | Yes, but I will need sponsorship | No, I need sponsorship now |
| Peloton | "By selecting Yes you confirm you do not require sponsorship" | the inverse, for everyone | the statement |
| Peloton | able to commute to the NYC HQ "(located at …)" | No for everyone (the office's address read as the applicant's) | Yes if moving, No if not |
| Nuro | 4 days a week "in our Mountain View, CA headquarters" (Seattle, will not move) | Yes | No |
| Sentinel (JazzHR) | "work out of our Wakefield, MA office 1 day per week" (Austin, will not move) | Yes | No |
| Relativity | "willing to commute and/or relocate? If not, explain" (text) | the applicant's city | Yes / blank |
| Squarespace | "Do you plan to move out of your state in 6-12 months?" | the current state | "I have no plans to move" / blank |
| Squarespace | most recently attended school (Turing School) | Parsons School of Design | blank |
| Waymo | state/region of residence (Berlin, India) | Other | EMEA, APAC |
| Samsara | enrolled in a bachelor's or graduated in the past 2 years (June 2026 graduate) | No | Yes |
| Stripe | "When do you expect to complete your degree?" | the degree's name | April 2027 / blank |
| Canonical | bachelor's degree result, with its grading system | the school and degree | 3.7/4.0 / blank |

**False failures** (written right, reported wrong): Waymo's phone "did not
stick" (read back as +14165550142), Greenhouse's "+1" reverted, Duolingo's
13 "didn't stick" (its widgets read back), Workday's month/range/veteran
"reverts", a running job's To date, Epic's Country.

## 4. Blanks now answered

- **Epic Games**: 16 dropdowns built on an older react-select (no combobox
  role) were invisible, then unlabelled; work authorization, sponsorship, how
  you heard, 40 hours a week, two acknowledgements, School/Degree/Discipline.
  13 fields filled before, 23 now.
- **Job's country on company career sites**: "Location" label/value pairs
  (Epic), the line under the job title (Databricks). Without it, work-right
  and sponsorship questions stayed blank.
- Seattle's city on Greenhouse (the lookup lists it twice); GitLab's visa
  list ("Yes, but not one of the visas listed here", "Yes, F-1 Visa OPT");
  Airbnb's "Yes … now / Yes … in the future".
- Export-control lists of embargoed places: "None of the above" when none of
  the applicant's countries is listed (Databricks).
- Graduates: "Earlier than Fall 2026", "Prior to December 2025", "Already
  graduated", "N/A (I have graduated already)".
- Start dates: onboarding date, start year, "available to begin before
  September 2028".
- Acknowledgements: Coinbase's AI notice, OneTrust/Samsara "Acknowledge/
  Confirm", Riot's E-Verify notice for everyone (a "Select..." placeholder
  had counted as an option).
- EEO in other words: "Black / Of African descent", a cisgender woman among
  transgender-only qualified options.

## 5. Decisions (one rule each, each easy to reverse)

1. A label that lists the applicant's own status as sponsorship ("e.g., …
   STEM OPT") makes "now" Yes; otherwise an OPT/EAD holder needs it later,
   not now.
2. A visa list: the applicant's visa, else "not listed"; no visa stated, blank.
3. A school is matched by its own words; no match leaves it blank (never
   "My school is not listed").
4. The profile's one GPA belongs to its main degree: blank for an
   undergraduate GPA when the main degree is a master's.
5. Plans to move: "no plans" only for someone who will not relocate.
6. Pledges about your own words or no AI use (Canonical, Twilio) stay blank:
   Tailrd may have written the words.
7. Consent to being recorded stays yours even when it is the only option.
8. Embargoed-place lists: answered only when every fact the question asks
   about is known and none of your countries is listed.
9. "Social media" is no particular platform; "Company website" is only the
   company's own site.
10. Old react-select widgets (aria-autocomplete="list", emotion class names)
    are dropdowns.

## 6. Regression

All 157 pinned pages from rounds 1 to 4, headful, in 13 batches (build of
bf9c7fc): 143 passed. The other 14 were re-run on the final build:

- 8 passed: four fixed during the run (Figma's "Other", Shield AI's "local
  to or willing to relocate", Hermeus' U.S.-person option, and hCaptcha's own
  frame showing up in the page dump), four were page-load flakes (GitAI,
  Figma, Mindex, Waymo).
- 5 now answer questions they used to leave blank; each answer was read and
  then pinned: Sentinel (No to the Wakefield office from Austin, Yes to the
  US work right), K1 (undergraduate year 2015, LinkedIn, the commute, Southern
  California), D2L (eligible in Canada), DoorDash ("Before December 2027").
  Commvault's channel for a stated "Job board" is now blank (it was the
  company's career page).
- 1, Bosch on SmartRecruiters, now sits behind a Cloudflare challenge that
  needs a POST; live runs block it.

Also on the final build: unit tests 1713/1713, type check clean, scan smoke
passed, and every multi-page probe: Workday one click to Review 73/73, the
generic multi-page flow, Workday account creation and its gate, the
react-select driver, Workday churn.

## 7. Needs you / needs manual verification

**Your decisions**
1. **Upload 0.5.0** (`tailrd-extension-0.5.0.zip`) and consider the two
   listing lines in `docs/store-submission.md`. I did not upload anything.
2. **Look at `EXTENSION_ALLOWED_IDS` on Vercel** (both ids); the evidence
   says it works, but I could not read it.
3. **Legal waivers are inconsistent.** Anthropic's and Roblox's arbitration
   agreements are accepted (round 3's decision 8: a lone acknowledgement is
   answered); Block's (a lone "Accept" checkbox) and Sweetgreen's ("Have you
   read and do you agree to the Arbitration Agreement?" with a lone Yes) stay
   blank. Say which you want for all of them.
4. **Does OpenAI work now?** Prod shows no AI output since 2026-08-25
   (`job_match_scores`). If it does, I can find a safe way to run real
   `/api/fill` answers in the lab; none of this round used the AI.

**Not verified live**
- School and Degree on Epic go to the AI with the real options (Turing
  School and "Certificate" are not in Greenhouse's lists).
- Breezy's work-history rows ("Start dateEnd dateDelete" label) need a page
  capture.
- Airbnb's career site (no form found) and AlayaCare (its Apply button times
  out in the harness).
- SmartRecruiters past the first page (DataDome, not allowed to bypass).

## 8. After the report: batches 3 and 4, four question banks (2026-10-05, early morning)

**Batch 3, the families seen least** (13 postings from prod `scraped_jobs`,
7 personas). Blind run first, then fixes, then two more live runs.

| family | page | reached the form? | wrong values (blind) | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rippling | 4AG Robotics (Berlin persona) | yes | phone: "493012345678" under the page's "+44" | "+49 DE" and "3012345678" |
| Recruitee | Huawei Canada | no: the form is in a hidden "Apply" tab, and three of its answers were filled unseen | 0 | opens the tab; name, email, phone |
| Paylocity | Choice Solutions | no: the email check is a POST | 0 | opens (the email check let through, nothing else); 21 fields right; State stays blank (below) |
| Jobvite | ACPM (French page) | no: "Poser sa candidature" | 0 | opens; 6 fields, all right |
| Dayforce | Eclipse | no: Apply's aria-label names the job; then a guest chooser | 0 | opens as a guest; 21 fields right after the fixes: Country, State and both dial codes were set but read as failed, How did you hear and Current Job were never seen |
| BambooHR | NextHop | yes | 0 | 11 fields, all right |
| CareerPuck (Greenhouse) | Domino | yes | 0 | 16 fields, all right |
| Breezy | Ninja Holdings | yes | 0 | 6 fields; the Chicago hybrid question now answered |
| Pinpoint | Franklin Electric | yes | 0 | 16 fields, all right |

Not cases (each stops before any field): ADP (sign-in), Avature (account
creation), Eightfold (only a job-alert signup on the posting), Acuity's
SuccessFactors (a menu leading to an SAP sign-in).

**Question banks 2 and 3**: 79 and then 74 more Greenhouse postings (bank 3
from boards our users saw that no bank had yet), 6 personas, about 9,000
answers more. Read the same way as bank 1; all banks re-run after every fix
and every changed answer read.

**Question bank 4: Workable.** Workable's public form endpoint serves every
posting's custom questions, so 89 postings from the 31 Workable accounts in
prod `scraped_jobs` (821 questions) were answered for the same six
personas and every answer read. It found the worst answers of the night:
three adults saying they were under 18, a first-person "I am authorized and
will not need sponsorship" answered backwards for everyone, a gender
identity typed into an EEO policy's name box, and a certification declined
for anyone who declines to state a disability. About 30 wrong answers, each
fixed with a failing test first (`test/bankWorkable.test.ts`).

**Batch 4: the bank's pages, live.** 11 of those Workable postings, each with
the persona that got a question wrong, run blind on the build with the
fixes, every write read: each fix it touched held on the real widgets. One
wrong value was written (No into Credence's at-will notice, "Initial to
agree."), and the live runs found two bugs the bank could not: every
Workable Yes/No question was reported "No option matches" beside the
native twin that filled it, and Saalex's tab froze (below). All three
fixed, then pinned: 11 pages, 279 checks.

### Blanks now answered (after the report)

- Apply buttons: by what they show (Dayforce's reads "Apply", its aria-label
  names the job), in French ("Poser sa candidature", "Candidater"), and the
  guest path beside a sign-in ("Apply without an Account").
- Phones: a dial-code picker is set to the number's own country; a box the
  page starts with "+1" is filled; a virtualized list (7 of 245 options
  rendered) is no longer read as the whole list; a filter that answers after
  a half-second debounce is waited for.
- Paylocity: its company name (read from the page).
- Rippling's Location (Google Places): a place search waits up to 4 s.
- "Have you worked with us before?", "Are you graduating in Spring 2027?",
  "Which college did you attend?", "…currently attending / did you graduate
  from?".
- Dayforce: its selects without a search box (How did you hear: LinkedIN),
  and Current Job ticked for the job still running.
- Workable bank: a LinkedIn or GitHub link asked for at length in a text
  area; "eligibility to work", "eligible to be employed", "file a petition
  … for employment-based status"; "Are you a U.S. person?"; French
  "Résidez-vous…" and "autorisés à occuper un emploi"; "Are you currently
  employed?"; "an internal employee of X"; "Latest/Most Recent Employer";
  "current degree program or highest level"; a clearance list's "I currently
  do not have an active security clearance"; an attention check ("please
  choose option C"); the state you will live and work in (US residents).
- An EU, EEA or Swiss citizen asked about another such country (Austria,
  France, Norway, Denmark): Yes, no sponsorship.

### Decisions (after the report)

11. A phone's dial-code picker takes the country of the number's own code
    (+44 is the United Kingdom wherever you live); the box beside it gets the
    national number. A picker or box showing only a code is the page's
    preset, so it is replaced.
12. "A student in F-1 status planning CPT/OPT?" is a visa question: Yes for
    F-1/OPT/CPT stated, No for any other status stated.
13. "Relevant full-time experience" counts technical titles; non-technical
    ones leave it to you.
14. A GPA on another scale than the form's is left blank (no conversion).
15. The guest path ("Apply without an Account") is always taken over signing
    in; no account is ever created.
16. A legal-status Yes in a question that also requires in-person work
    somewhere you will not move to becomes No.
17. A how/why or yes/no question in a text box never gets a fact its words
    mention (title, city, school, salary); experience of one kind never gets
    the whole work history.
18. "Permanent" or "unrestricted" work authorization is a citizen's or
    permanent resident's; a question naming two countries joined by "or"
    counts either.
19. A stated referral answers "referred by an employee?" Yes; who referred
    you is always left to you (the AI is kept out of it too).
20. A salary written in a currency is never put in a list, or a box, that
    asks for another currency.
21. A sanctioned-countries question is read for the countries it lists,
    never for "U.S. export control laws" around them.
22. An EU, EEA or Swiss citizen is authorized to work in every other such
    country and needs no sponsorship there (freedom of movement). The UK is
    not one of them.
23. A long statement (40 words or more) is read by what it asks: its
    questions, its requests ("Please indicate…"), its last sentence that is
    not a note, and a short title before a dash. What it merely mentions
    (gender identity, disability, a criminal check, an employer) never
    decides the field. A lone "I Agree" still acknowledges the whole text.
24. Experience narrowed by an activity ("performing X", "owning Y") is
    never the career total; when the dated career is shorter than the
    years asked, the answer is No.
25. An attention check that names its option ("choose option C") is
    answered as it says.
26. Another country's list of states or provinces, without the applicant's
    own, is left blank and kept from the AI.
27. An affirmation of a negative ("I affirm that I have not entered into any
    non-compete or NDA") is left to you, never defaulted: most people have
    signed an NDA.
28. A Dayforce work start date stays blank when the profile knows only the
    month (unchanged since 2026-10-03: no invented day).

### Regression (after the report)

Every pinned page, three times, 13 per batch, headful:

- **Regression 1** (build of 4bb117b, 166 pages): 154 passed as scored. Of
  the 12 others, 5 passed when re-run on the next build (MongoDB, Palantir,
  Planet and Anduril with bank 3's company and school fixes; one Workable
  page); 5 answered more than their pins and were re-pinned after each
  answer was read (Rippling's phone code on two pages, Recruitee's "+1"
  box, Breezy's hybrid question, Paylocity's company question); Databricks'
  OneTrust cookie boxes became page-owned (they mount late with the page's
  own defaults; the scanner never touches them); Bosch sat behind a
  Cloudflare challenge.
- **Regression 2** (build of 4bc02f1, 166 pages): 161 passed. ServiceNow sat behind a
  Cloudflare challenge (like Bosch); the other four (Ashby's second school
  search, Databricks' school, CareerPuck's late form, Lever's location
  typeahead) passed when re-run alone on the next build.
- **Regression 3** (build of 31a4371, 177 pages with batch 4): 169 passed
  as scored. Pinpoint IDT now answers its federal-employment disclosure
  (No; read by what it asks) and two page-owned values appeared (Recruitee's
  language switcher, DISA's address that Workable fills from the visitor's
  location): read, then pinned. Astranis' Discipline and Rippling 4AG's
  Google Places location passed re-run alone. Open: Bosch (Cloudflare),
  BambooHR Armstrong (its form never loaded, twice), Ashby Superhuman's
  second school (below).

### Needs you / not verified (after the report)

- **The harness browser takes this machine's locale**: Pinpoint presets
  Country to Canada and Rippling its phone code to +44 for every persona.
  With a US locale Pinpoint presets the US. Real users get their own; the
  extension never overwrites a country already shown.
- Recruitee and Breezy stop at the résumé upload, BambooHR, CareerPuck and
  Jobvite at a captcha: the fields before them are verified, the steps after
  are not.
- **Workable's frozen tab (Saalex).** Paused in the debugger, the loop is
  Workable's own date-format code, re-rendering after the State changed
  with dates already typed. We now type dates last and the page finishes
  (both personas, live). Not verified: whether a person who changes the
  State themselves after the dates are filled freezes it too (a plain
  browser test was blocked by the page's overlays). If a user reports a
  frozen Workable tab, this is the first suspect.
- **Paylocity's own State select stays "Select a state" live.** Its menu
  never opens for us (the unit replica fills; the live widget does not). A
  plain browser could not open it either: a page modal and the cookie
  banner sit over it. It needs a session with the modal closed.
- **Paylocity's "How did you hear" is chosen, and still reported "No option
  matches".** The radios carry plain labels; the cause is not found. The
  page is right; the panel's count of fields needing attention is one too
  many there.
- **Dayforce**: Preferred Contact Method goes to the AI; the required work
  Start Dates stay blank (decision 28); Not Completed and Duties go to the
  AI.
- **Workable fills its Address from the visitor's location** (this
  machine's own city, for every persona) and the extension never overwrites a value
  already there: a real user gets their own city, someone applying from
  elsewhere gets the page's guess. Flourish's Zip box shows the "10119" we
  type as "10,119" (the page's formatting).
- DISA's posting dropped its Education section since it was pinned; its
  education pins now apply only when the section is there.
- **Ashby Superhuman's second school row**: Ashby re-mounts the row while
  the first school is chosen, and the second reports "Field no longer
  found" (regressions 2 and 3, and alone on the final build; it filled on
  the 07:13 build). Timing on Ashby's side; a rescan-and-retry of a stale
  row would fix it. Not done tonight.
- **BambooHR Armstrong** never showed its form in regression 3 or alone:
  the posting may have closed. Check before re-pinning.
- ServiceNow and Bosch on SmartRecruiters are behind Cloudflare challenges
  that need a POST; live runs block them, so they are not verified.

# One Autofill click to the end of a Workday application (2026-10-04, night)

You asked to finish a full Workday application with a single Autofill click:
the next page shows at the bottom of the panel and the flow carries on by
itself, without another Autofill click, to the end. Same branch, still local
only: NOT pushed, NOT deployed. Nothing was submitted anywhere.

**What it does now.** Click Autofill once on the job posting. The flow opens
the application (Apply, then Apply Manually), creates the account with the
email and password saved under Autofill Information > Account creation, and
fills each page. When a page is filled, the panel's bottom button counts down
("Next page in 2s ▶", or "Create Account in 2s ▶" on the account page) and
the page turns by itself. It stops on the Review page and never clicks Submit.

- Press the button to go at once.
- **Pause** (beside it) holds the page: the button becomes "Continue To The
  Next Page ▶" and waits for you. Clicking or typing in the page while it
  counts down holds it the same way. A hold lasts one page.
- A page with a required question still empty waits for you, as before.
- If you turn a page with the site's own button, the flow follows and fills
  the new page.
- Off switch: `flowAutoContinue` in the extension's settings (on by default,
  no panel toggle yet; the e2e harness turns it off).

**How it was tested.** A real Workday application needs an account and real
submissions, both off limits here. So I built a replica of one
(`test/browser/fixtures/workdayReplica.mjs`), served under a real Workday
address so the extension's Workday code runs, with Workday's field names
taken from Workday's own application code (the Capital One page capture in
`test/e2e/results/har/`). It has the posting, the Apply Manually chooser,
Create Account (hidden consent box, live password rules, and the click
overlay Workday puts over that button, whose handler is on the overlay), My
Information, My Experience (rows behind
Add buttons, month/year boxes, search lists, the résumé drop zone),
Application Questions, Voluntary Disclosures, Self Identify and Review, as one
app with one reused footer button, loading skeletons and re-renders. What is
checked is what each page itself registered when it was saved.

`npm run test:workday-flow`, real Chromium, the packaged extension, a US
applicant with three jobs, a degree, EEO answers and a résumé:

| scenario | result |
| --- | --- |
| one click on the posting, then hands off | Review in about 47 s; all six steps saved in order, none rejected; 40 checks on what each page registered (55 answers); Submit never clicked (48/48) |
| Pause on a counting page | held 5 s, Continue turned it, the rest by itself (9/9) |
| clicking into the page during the countdown | held the same way (7/7) |
| the site's own Save and Continue during the countdown | followed, next page filled, nothing skipped or saved twice (9/9) |

**What the replica caught.** These would have stopped or corrupted a real
Workday application. All fixed, each with a test that fails on the old code:

| page | problem | now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| My Information | State (Workday's `countryRegion`) read as the country: no option matched, left empty | "Texas" |
| My Information | Phone Device Type read as the phone number: left empty | "Mobile" |
| My Information | Phone Extension read as the phone number: the number was typed into it | left blank, never guessed (nor asked of the AI) |
| any page with a required radio question | the flow believed answered radio groups were empty and waited ("Have you previously worked for Acme?"); older than this work | fixed |
| My Experience | dates written like "Jun 2012" were typed whole into each box: the Month box read "2012" | month 6, year 2012 |
| My Experience | the education "To (Actual or Expected)" year (`lastYearAttended`) never filled | the graduation year |
| Voluntary Disclosures | ethnicity read as the city ("ethni**city**Dropdown"): left empty | the stated race |
| Self Identify | the date was recognized too weakly to be filled | today's date |
| Self Identify | the disability boxes ("Please check one of the boxes below:") were not recognized as the disability question; "Prefer not to say" found no "I do not want to answer"; an answer with a comma came out twice | "I do not want to answer" |
| Review | no fields on the page, so the flow ended with "No application form found" and never set up Submit tracking | ends at Review; your submit is recorded in the dashboard |

Also fixed: `comboboxEngine.ts` had a literal NUL byte in a string since
August, so git treated it as binary (its diffs read "Binary files differ").

**Your three rules.** Kept, with one refinement to the in-person rule:
occasional visits (team gatherings, offsites, a few trips a year, a quarterly
visit) are not in-person work, so someone who will not relocate no longer
gets No for them. A regular schedule with occasional offsites still counts as
in-person. Enrollment and U.S. clearance rules unchanged.

**Decisions** (each easy to change)
1. The countdown is 2 seconds (`AUTO_ADVANCE_MS` in `flowController.ts`).
2. The account page turns by itself again, with your saved credentials. An
   August change had made it wait for a press; that was not something you
   asked for.
3. A hold (Pause, or touching the page) lasts one page, not the whole run.
4. A press restarts the flow's 10-minute limit, so a page you held while
   reading no longer times out when you press Continue.

**Tests**
- Unit: 1619/1619 (134 files). Type check clean.
- Browser: Workday replica 73/73; the generic multi-page probe (now
  hands-free), the Workday account and account-gate probes, the churn,
  shadow-click and driver probes, extension load: all pass. Browser suite
  19/19.
- Live pinned pages touched by today's shared changes (decline wording,
  disability/veteran groups, every page with a checkbox group): 37 pages and
  the synthetic Workday forms. All pass. Four pins changed on purpose:
  three held-out Lever pages now take the form's decline for an applicant who
  stated no disability answer (as every other EEO question already did;
  "I do not want to answer" was not recognized as a decline), and the
  synthetic Workday form's ethnicity is now answered. Two pages (Workable
  FSSI, Rippling 4AG) missed one field on the first run and passed on a rerun.

**Needs you / manual verification**
- **A real Workday application, end to end.** Not testable here. In
  particular, unverified on real Workday:
  - its live password-rule messages: if they stay on screen once the
    password is valid, the flow reads them as errors and waits on the
    account page for one press;
  - tenants that send a verification email after Create Account: the flow
    stops there; after verifying and signing in, click Autofill again;
  - whether a tenant uses the older ids (`addressSection_countryRegion`,
    `phone-device-type`) or the newer ones (`formField-countryRegion`,
    `formField-phoneType`): both are handled, only the older ones were in the
    replica.
- **The AI path.** These runs use a dead AI, so what the AI writes for the
  fields still sent to it (role descriptions, essays) was not seen.
- **Known noise.** The extension's own report flags some correct Workday
  answers as "reverted": a month box compared with the whole date, a
  dropdown answer compared with the profile's wording ("6" vs "5-7 years").
  The pages hold the right values; only the self-report is wrong. Telemetry
  only, nothing on screen.

# Round 3: new forms, new people (2026-10-03, night)

You asked to keep going and to vary the data, the cases and the forms. Same
branch, still local only: NOT pushed, NOT deployed. Nothing was submitted
(every non-GET request blocked except GraphQL queries and, on Paylocity only,
its read-only email lookup).

**What ran.** Five new synthetic people (in `test/e2e/profiles.mjs`, no real
data) on 33 live postings from prod `scraped_jobs`, chosen so the job and the
applicant disagree in useful ways:

| person | what makes them different |
| --- | --- |
| US veteran, Austin | Army service, an active clearance with no level, will not relocate, prefers remote |
| London senior engineer | UK only, MSc 2016 and BA 2015, transgender woman, bisexual, a stated disability |
| Montreal career changer | French degree names, teacher then developer, non-binary, Hispanic, education listed oldest first |
| Calgary new grad | no work history, declines every EEO question, starts next week |
| US green-card student | permanent resident, December 2027 graduation, a TA job and a past internship |

Forms: JazzHR, Breezy, Recruitee, Pinpoint, Paylocity, Oracle (families the
suite had never seen), Greenhouse forms embedded on company sites (MongoDB,
D2L, Zipline, Brex), Workable, BambooHR, Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever, Jobvite.

**TL;DR.** Reading every write found 20 kinds of wrong answer written on
live pages (several on more than one page), 3 more the code would have given
had the page let it, and about 30 blanks a stated fact settles. All are
fixed, each with a test that fails on the old code, and each fix was
re-checked on its live page. Commits `fbbe0bf` to `3975b2c`; the 33 pages
are now pinned (541 checks).

### Wrong answers found (fixed)

| page | question | wrote | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pinpoint | Address lines, Town, Postcode | the LinkedIn URL (a section's legend labelled every field) | the address parts |
| Pinpoint, Paylocity | Address Line 2 | a copy of line 1 | blank (or the unit, "app. 3") |
| Breezy (Vagaro) | years developing with C# / ASP.NET Core | "3+ years" (six years of teaching) | blank (no such experience stated) |
| Breezy (Vagaro) | race, on an EEO-1 combined list | "Two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino)" for a Hispanic applicant | the Hispanic option |
| Breezy (NinjaHoldings) | expected month and year of graduation | "2027" | "December 2027" |
| Breezy (NinjaHoldings) | "What is your major? Please describe why…" | the major alone, in an essay box | left to the essay path |
| Paylocity | how did you hear | "Online Job Board" for a stated "Career fair" | "Other", with "Career fair" in its box |
| Paylocity | an education row's City | the applicant's city | blank (it is the school's) |
| Zipline (embedded Greenhouse) | Location (City) | "San Jose, Costa Rica" for San Jose, CA | San Jose, California |
| Zipline | available next Spring (Jan to Apr/May 2027)? | Yes, for someone who cannot start before late May | No |
| Kenect (Breezy) | hybrid schedule out of Pleasant Grove, Utah? | Yes, for an Austin applicant who will not move | No |
| JazzHR | gender, race | the page's own pre-selected "Decline to answer" kept | the stated answers |
| Robinhood and others | veteran / military status | "never served" guessed from "not a protected veteran" | only what the answer says (decided with you) |
| Superhuman (Ashby) | education rows | both rows the latest school, the first row's year | each row its own |
| Superhuman (Ashby) | End Date | "October 2017": the page picks today's month when only a year is chosen | blank |
| Superhuman | sexual orientation | "Lesbian" for "Gay or Lesbian" | left for you |
| Brex, Zoox, Vagaro | gender | a decline for a stated "Non-binary" the list lacks | left for you |
| Zoox (Lever) | currently enrolled in a CS program? | Yes, for a graduate | No |
| Zoox | school schedule allowing part-time at the Foster City office? | Yes, for a developer out of school | No |
| Palantir (Lever) | major | "Other" for an MSc in Computing | Computer Science |
| Anthropic, Mindex | in person at our offices / at the Rochester office? | (code) Yes, from the accept-the-requirement default; live they reached the AI | No, for someone who will not move |
| Twitch | permanent resident after your latest citizenship? | (code) "United States" for a yes/no; the page refused it | No |
| Paylocity | School Type | (code) the school's name; no option took it | "College / University" |

### Blanks a stated fact now answers

- **SpaceX:** work authorization offered as five statements ("authorized ... for any employer"), "Citizenship Status" ((b) lawful permanent resident), a major the list lacks ("Other (Technical)").
- **School search lists** that found nothing: "San José State University" (Greenhouse, Ashby), "The University of Texas at Austin" (Greenhouse lists "University of Texas - Austin").
- **Palantir:** the university "last attended", a graduation or high-school year the list does not offer ("Other").
- **Hermeus:** a past internship with its details, a country list for "What is your location?", "If no, will you require sponsorship in the future?".
- **Mindex:** a co-op for a graduate (No), "I currently work here", the Rochester office (No; the page draws its location after the first scan).
- **Zoox:** research and grants for someone out of school (No), a checkbox question that had no label.
- **Paylocity:** per education row, "Did you Graduate?", "Degree Obtained", "Area of Study"; its react-widgets dropdowns now verify (a pick that stuck was reported as failed), and Address Line 1 keeps the street when its autocomplete suggests nothing.
- **Pinpoint:** able to obtain a U.S. clearance (No for a permanent resident).
- **Superhuman:** LinkedIn without "https://" in a URL box, the French degree's field ("Psychologie").
- **Batch B list:** a current MongoDB employee, availability, how soon, "If referred, by who?", 50 states as radios, a lone-Yes consent.

### Decisions (each one rule, easy to reverse)

1. **Education rows are told apart by position** when a form repeats the same
   ids in every row (Ashby). One row on the page is still your main education.
2. **Ashby End Date stays blank for a year-only graduation.** Checked live:
   choosing only the year makes the page set the month to the current one,
   and only the month sets the current year.
3. **Every program finished = not a student**, firmly (it was a "maybe", and
   those questions went to the AI).
4. **A student's questions asked of a graduate:** a co-op, a school schedule,
   research or grants are No; "which degree are you pursuing" and "expected
   graduation" are left blank.
5. **In-person questions that name no full place use the posting's places.**
   An office in your city: Yes. Every office in another state or country, and
   you will not relocate: No. Another city in your own state: yours.
6. **Kept from the AI** (left for you; the AI has the same profile and could
   only guess): government history when a government employer is in it (is
   the Army one?), a clearance level the profile does not name, a high
   school's name, consent to AI notetakers, "If yes, please describe"
   follow-ups, a student's school schedule, a date the profile knows only to
   the month in a day picker, Address Line 2 without a unit.
7. **A U.S. clearance needs U.S. citizenship:** "able to obtain one?" is No
   for a permanent resident or visa holder. A citizen's answer stays yours.
8. **Lists:** a year or school the list does not offer is its own "Other" /
   "not listed" option (native selects only: a search box's loaded options
   are not the whole list). Accents are folded when options are matched.

### Not cases (measured, not testable here)

ADP Workforce Now and iCIMS open their forms only behind a sign-in (no
accounts may be created). A CareerPuck board links out to Greenhouse.
Coinbase opens its form in a new tab, Samsara lazy-loads its iframe only when
scrolled to, Fivetran keeps the form behind an "Application" tab, and both
Rippling postings were taken down.

### Test results

- **Unit:** 1579/1579 (132 files).
- **Round 3, pinned (33 live pages):** 33/33 pages, 541/541 checks on
  `0d08d2f`. The three fixes after it touch none of these pages; Brex-MTL,
  the one candidate, re-ran on `6dfef72`: 20/20.
- **Older pinned suite (86 live pages + 3 framework fixtures):** the first
  run on `0d08d2f` found three regressions (below), all fixed and re-run
  live. Every other difference was read and was an intended round-3 change,
  re-pinned (`8360f68`, `6dfef72`, `079df2b`, `3975b2c`). Final: 88/89. The
  89th is SmartRecruiters' Bosch page, behind its DataDome block on this
  machine, as before this round.
- **Network:** one batch hit DNS failures (`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`); its
  pages were re-run and passed. Nothing here is from that batch.

**Harness changes:** a case may let through exact read-only endpoints
(Paylocity's email lookup: blocked, the page broke). The page dump reads a
div combobox's shown value (react-widgets showed as empty before) and numbers
repeated label keys, so a second education row can be pinned. Ashby radios
are pinned by label (their ids change every load), dates by their shape.

**Found by the regression run (fixed, each with a test):**
- Brex's "Do you currently live in, or plan to relocate to…?" stayed blank:
  its options ("Yes, I live here", "Yes, I plan to relocate") have commas, and
  a comma was all it took to read a list as places (`7b6657b` had passed the
  applicant's place to the react-select driver). A place now names a known
  state, province or country, or a name ("Costa Rica"), never a phrase.
- FSSI's "Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science… strongly preferred" got NO
  from the rule meant for Paylocity's "Did you Graduate?", which answered
  outside an education row. It answers in a row only now.
- Paylocity's dropdowns: my first fix read the widget's kept option list as
  its value, so the fill believed a choice was already made. Caught on the
  re-run, fixed before the pins (`0d08d2f`).
- Older than this round: "today" was the UTC day, a day ahead every evening
  in the Americas ("2 weeks from today" at 9 p.m. in Ottawa started a day
  late). It is your own calendar day now.

### Needs you / manual verification

**Decisions you may want to reverse** (each is one rule)
- "Currently enrolled?" is now a firm No once every listed program has
  finished. If a profile lags behind (a new program not added yet), that No
  is wrong until the profile is updated.
- "Able to obtain a U.S. security clearance?" is No for a permanent resident
  or visa holder. U.S. rules grant clearances to citizens (a rare limited
  access for others exists); a citizen's answer is left to them.
- In-person questions get No when every office the posting lists is in
  another state or country and the applicant will not relocate. A remote-
  first company asking about occasional office visits gets the same No.

**Not verified**
- **The AI path.** These runs use a dead AI (the harness's fake API), so what
  the AI writes for the fields still sent to it (essays, "Why X?", the
  questions left to it) was not seen. Fewer fields go to it now: the "kept
  from the AI" list above leaves them for you instead.
- **Paylocity's address autocomplete with a US address.** Verified only that
  a UK street stays when nothing is suggested. If it suggests US addresses,
  the pick path is untested here.
- **Page prefills from the machine's location.** Pinpoint pre-selects
  "Canada" as the address country and Workable (Syntiant) "Gatineau, Canada"
  as the address, from this machine's IP. The extension never overwrites a
  value already in a field, so an applicant abroad keeps the page's guess.
- **Later steps** behind a captcha or the resume wall, as before.
- **Address Line 1 without its unit** when a Line 2 takes it: unit tests
  only; no round-3 page has both for the Montreal persona.

**Known limits**
- Ashby with a year-only graduation leaves End Date blank (month and year to
  fill by hand). Completed degrees store only a year; storing the month
  would let it fill.
- Telemetry still logs Greenhouse's phone country picker as changed ("+1"
  read back for "United States"): no dial-code table.
- Not testable here: ADP and iCIMS (sign-in walls), CareerPuck (link-out),
  Coinbase (new tab), Samsara (lazy iframe), Fivetran (Application tab),
  two taken-down Rippling postings.

# Run with your real profile (2026-10-03, evening)

You asked: "run for real with my profile". The extension ran on 40 live
application pages (the complete round's 18 and the fresh round's 22) with your
prod profile. The profile was read with SELECT-only queries and assembled by
the backend's own builder, so the extension saw exactly what prod sends it.
Nothing was submitted: every non-GET request was blocked except GraphQL
queries, so no submissions, uploads or accounts. Your profile copy and the
per-page results stay out of the repo (scratchpad, and the gitignored
`test/e2e/results/`). Same branch, still local only, not pushed, not deployed.

**TL;DR.** The first pass wrote **20 wrong answers (7 causes)** that the test
profiles never triggered, and left **17 questions blank** that your profile
can answer. All are fixed (`93f1d4a`, `5bead3d`, `7c77dac`), each with a test
that fails on the old code. On the fixed build the 20 wrong answers are gone
and the 17 blanks are filled, on the same live pages: 38 in the second full
pass, Robinhood's and Anthropic's in single-page re-runs after their later
fixes (one Lever location dropdown ignored its pick once; a known flaky
widget). What is still blank is missing from your profile (list below) or
genuinely yours to answer: essays, US work authorization and sponsorship,
citizenship, recording consent.

### Wrong answers on the first pass (fixed)

| page(s) | question | wrote | cause | now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Robinhood, Superhuman | race | one subgroup of a broader answer | the matcher took the first option containing the answer's word, though several options were narrower subgroups of it | left for you: you pick |
| Robinhood | gender identity | a cisgender option | guessed from the gender answer; your gender identity is blank. The list loads only when opened, so the fix needed the retry path too (`5bead3d`) | "I don't wish to answer" |
| ActioNet | current or former government employee? (and 2 follow-ups) | No | the "never a government employee" default ignored your federal internship | left for you |
| ActioNet | Active Clearance/Public Trust? | Yes | your "Active clearance" read as a US clearance | left for you (the AI is kept out too) |
| Lever (Palantir, Hermeus, Zoox, PCC, Neighbor, Arc'teryx, Veeva, Agiloft), Commvault, Rippling (4AG, FluidAI) | Current company | your internship employer | the backend sends the resume's first job whether or not it ended (yours ended 05/2026) | blank |
| Enova | How did you hear? | Campus Career Site | a campus channel was the only "career site" option | LinkedIn (the default order) |
| Anthropic | "the address from which you plan on working? If you would need to relocate, please type \"relocating\"" | your home city | the instruction was ignored; the role is in-office in the US | "relocating" (you said you will relocate) |

### Blanks your profile answers (fixed)

| page(s) | question | now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 of the 8 Lever pages | Current location | "Gatineau, QC, CAN": your bare "Gatineau" matched Gatineau, Quebec and Gatineau, Haiti. On Arc'teryx, Lever ignored the pick once (a known flaky widget) |
| Workable (Mindex, Rave, FSSI) | Title (required) | your internship title, beside the company already filled |
| ActioNet | highest education | Some College |
| SpaceX | GRE | Did not take/Do not recall |
| Voldex | available in Eastern/Pacific hours? | Yes |
| Enova | local to Chicago for summer 2027? | Yes (you are willing to relocate) |
| Netlify | accommodation for the interview? | from the profile's disability answer (No only when it states none) |
| Agiloft | disability (radios with no label) | the option matching the profile's disability answer |
| Planet | how did you first hear about Planet? (required) | Other - Job Site |

### Decisions (new policy; each is one rule, easy to reverse)

1. **An EEO answer broader than the options is left for you**, not declined:
   you stated it, so you pick the subgroup. An exact option still wins.
2. **Gender identity split by cis/trans options needs a stated identity.**
   Without one: an unqualified option that fits ("Man", "Non-binary"), else
   the decline. LGBTQ+ is Yes for a stated orientation or identity that is
   one, No only when both are stated and neither is.
3. **"Current company / title" means a job still running.** The backend sends
   the resume's first job whatever its end date; a field labelled current now
   gets nothing when every job has ended. A bare "Company" / "Title" (an
   experience entry) still gets the most recent job.
4. **A clearance holds in your own country.** A question in another country's
   terms ("Public Trust", "TS/SCI", DOE "Q") or on a job abroad is left for
   you; "None" holds everywhere.
5. **No "never a government employee" default when your history has a
   government employer.** A procurement or government OFFICIAL is a role: a
   developer intern's "No" there stands.
6. **Answers from stated facts that were "blank by design" this morning:** an
   interview accommodation is "No" only when the profile states no disability;
   "will you be local to <city>?" follows your relocation answer (as Brex's
   "plan to relocate" already did).
7. **The default "how did you hear" is never a campus channel**, and among
   several job searches it takes the one no brand names.

### Fix in your profile (these are data, not bugs)

1. **Current title is stored as "No".** The extension now ignores it.
2. **Your salary expectation has a stray space inside the number.** It is
   typed as written (Twitch, Planet, BambooHR, Agiloft), and ActioNet's
   number-only box stays blank because it is not a number.
3. **Earliest start 2026-08-28 is in the past**, so start-date questions get
   today (10/03/2026) or "Immediately". Set it if you are applying for summer
   2027 internships.
4. **No expected graduation.** Your education ends "Present"; the 2028 date is
   only in your resume's achievements text, which no field maps. About ten
   pages asked (ZipRecruiter, Astranis, Figma, Robinhood, Palantir, Hermeus,
   Superhuman, Ramp, Brattle, Enova, 4AG). Fill "Expected graduation".
5. **Work authorization is one general "yes".** US-job authorization and
   sponsorship questions stay blank (correct: nothing says what your US
   status is). Fill "Authorized to work in the US" and "in Canada".
6. **Gender identity is blank**, so cis/trans-split identity questions and
   LGBTQ+ decline. Fill it if you want them answered.
7. **No GPA, languages, cover letter or "how did you hear"**: those questions
   stay blank or take the defaults.

Items 4 and 5 are the new profile fields from today: they persist only once
the backend and web app are deployed together.

### Test results

- **Unit:** 1443/1443 (129 files).
- **Your profile, live (40 pages, nothing submitted):** first pass (build
  `a497700`) 540 writes, 20 of them wrong; second pass (build `93f1d4a`) 538
  writes, 18 of the 20 gone and the 17 blanks filled; the last two (Robinhood
  identity, Anthropic address) fixed and verified page by page on the final
  build.
- **Pinned regression suite** (`results/after-real`, build `5bead3d`): 1457/1490
  checks. Every miss was read: 11 cases differ by the intended answers above
  (re-pinned), one posting was taken down (Workable TSA: API 404, removed
  from the suite), one is SmartRecruiters' DataDome block on this machine (as
  before).
- **Final build, full re-run (`results/final-real`): stopped by the system
  for low memory after 36 of 104 cases, all 36 passing** (9 of the 12
  re-pinned cases among them, Anthropic's "relocating" included). The other
  68 were not re-run on the final build; they passed on `5bead3d` apart from
  the two above, and the final build's later changes (the relocation
  instruction, the dumper's uuid keys) touch none of their questions.
  Re-run with `node build.mjs && node test/e2e/run.mjs` when memory allows.

### Needs you / manual verification

**Your decisions** (both settled later the same evening)
- **Military status:** no longer inferred. "I am not a protected veteran"
  fills only an option saying exactly that; the profile gained "I have never
  served in the military", which fills every never-served wording (`fbbe0bf`,
  see Round 3 above).
- **Planet's "How did you find this position?"** keeps "Other - Job Site", as
  you confirmed: job sites come first in the default order (a posting found
  through Tailrd was found on a job site).

**Not verified**
- **Resume attach:** not exercised (uploads are blocked in these runs). Your
  stored PDF exists in prod (`has_file` true), so auto-attach has a file.
- **Later steps:** 17 pages stop at the captcha and 12 at "attach your resume"
  after step 1, so a second page of questions (if any) was not seen.
- **The follow-up dialog** that asks you about what stays blank (the race
  subgroup, for one) was not opened in these runs.
- **Flaky widgets, both seen with test profiles too:** Lever's location
  (Arc'teryx ignored the pick once) and Rippling FluidAI's location ("couldn't
  open the dropdown").

**Backend follow-up (not changed tonight)**
- `backend/routers/profile.py:431` sends the resume's first job as
  `currentCompany` whatever its end date, and `currentTitle` falls back to
  that job's title only when the stored job title is empty (yours holds "No",
  so the fallback never runs). The extension compensates now; anything else
  reading the profile still sees an ended internship as current.
- The stored title "No" most likely came from the extension's old follow-up
  dialog saving a yes/no into the title slot; that save is blocked since
  `3c0c919`. Onboarding no longer writes the job function there (`a497700`).

# Day session: answer every question without AI (2026-10-03)

Same branch, still local only (NOT pushed, NOT deployed). You asked for three
things: Brex's form filled properly; every question answered without AI
(mapping and defaults, with AI only for essays and the genuinely unanswerable);
and new profile fields wherever no mapping could supply an answer, added to the
extension panel, the web app and onboarding. Then: test on real pages, fix,
retest. The overnight notes below are unchanged except where this section
says it supersedes them.

**TL;DR.** The extension now answers the standard screening questions on the
device: consent, posting requirements, prior applications and referrals,
relatives inside, conflicts, government officials, how you heard about the
job, relocation, EEO (declined when the profile says nothing), start dates, test
scores, export-control status and more. AI is left for essays and judgement
questions. Five profile answers no mapping can supply (US / Canada work
authorization, how you heard, expected graduation month, GPA) are in the
extension panel, the web Profile page, onboarding and the backend. Brex now
fills completely: every question is answered except three correctly blank
follow-ups.

Testing on real pages found real bugs in every round:
- **Complete-profile round:** "no sponsorship needed" for US jobs on 7 pages,
  caused by that morning's own new per-country field. Also a mangled BambooHR
  date, an invented graduation day, an H-1B history question answered as
  sponsorship, and a dropdown counted as filled when it was empty.
- **Blind round on 22 postings never seen before:** 9 wrong writes.
- **Regression runs of the pinned suite:** 3 more (ActioNet, ZipRecruiter, an
  Ashby end date).
- **Read-through of my own new rules:** 3 that would have over-reached, plus one
  answer that was right only by luck.

All are fixed, each with a test that fails on the old code. On the final build:
- the pinned regression suite passes **64/64 cases (42 live pages), 825/825
  checks**;
- the two new committed live rounds (40 more pages, 626 reviewed pins) pass
  **40/40**, the run they were pinned from;
- unit tests: **1411/1411**.

Not pushed, not deployed.

### What changed today (commits on top of the overnight `c0b43f3`)

| commit | what |
| --- | --- |
| `ce65496` | **Default answers on device** (`defaultAnswers.ts`), **EEO decline**, **consent policy**, react-select options re-resolved on device, a recovery pass for fields the page clears, a pass for questions that appear during the fill |
| `1c63c18` | e2e expectations re-pinned to the new policy (101 new writes reviewed one by one first) |
| `15ddffc` | **Five new profile answers** across the extension panel, web Profile page, onboarding and backend |
| `bd01bfe` | **The job's city**, and an embedded form asks the page around it where the job is |
| `7f217c1` | **Conditional questions** answered only when their condition holds; "what sponsorship would you require?" no longer gets the authorization statement |
| `a11f4a3` | `COMPLETE_CANADIAN` e2e profile (every screening answer filled in) |
| `22f7628` | Never "no sponsorship needed" for a country the applicant cannot work in; citizenship kept beside the explicit answers |
| `3702db9` | Month-name date pickers ("dd mon yyyy"); a graduation month never becomes a day |
| `a167849` | Education end month from the expected graduation; Ashby's unlabeled date selects; "Still Student?" |
| `d4505e3` | The blanks a complete profile left on live pages (work right, employment history, export status, test scores, channels, acknowledgements, SMS, gender identity, …) |
| `93d19b5` | Languages checklist, "Other" for an unlisted major, the disability form's signature date |
| `7f65ee4` | An open list's highlighted option is not a selection |
| `b7e71e1` | H-1B history; Ashby graduation radios; "Still Student?" selection; label-only fill diagnostics; e2e `afterFill` hook |
| `1ee0260` | Blind round on 22 fresh postings: 9 wrong writes and the blanks behind them (incl. same-job-only carry-over, "Country - City", form-implied job country) |
| `b455627` | A current student's Ashby End Date is the page's; "did you graduate from" is no date |
| `93966d7` | Three default rules narrowed before they meet a page |
| `4004008` | Start-time spans; no dates in numeric buckets; demographic synonyms at scan time; form-country hint retried |
| `926f39a` | A stated channel offered several ways picks its job-search variant |
| `23e1f67`, `441016a` | The two live rounds committed as cases (`real-live-complete.mjs`, `real-live-fresh.mjs`); re-pins after review |

### Decisions (these supersede overnight decisions #1 and #7 where they differ)

1. **Defaults answer as a typical applicant who accepts the posting's terms
   and is unencumbered.** Yes to: application consents and certifications,
   in-office / on-site / hybrid / travel / schedule requirements, background
   checks, essential functions, being considered for future roles. No to: applied
   or interviewed before, referred by an employee, relatives inside, conflicts of
   interest, non-competes, government official, background-check obstacles,
   marketing / SMS / newsletter opt-ins. A profile fact always wins over a
   default (a stated "won't relocate" answers No).
2. **Never defaulted:** work authorization, sponsorship, citizenship, criminal
   history, relocation ASSISTANCE (a request, not a requirement), recording /
   AI-notetaker consent, and in-office requirements when the profile says Remote.
   Those stay blank unless the profile states them.
3. **Consent: every application consent is given, including the
   demographic-data consent.** You asked for all questions to be answered, so
   this reverses the overnight fix for bug #36 by design. Decision #7's
   inconsistency is gone: clear consent wording is always ticked.
4. **EEO with no profile answer → the decline option** ("Decline to
   self-identify", "I don't wish to answer"). It discloses nothing and stops a
   required EEO question from blocking submit. A list with no decline option
   stays blank (Workday's veteran select).
5. **"How did you hear about us"**: the profile's answer, mapped onto the form's
   wording ("Career fair" → "University Career Fair"). With none set: a job-board
   option, else the company website, else "internet", else LinkedIn, else
   "Other". Free text gets "Online job board".
6. **"Are you located here, or would you relocate?"**: "located here" when the
   profile city is the job's city, "relocate" otherwise, "No" when the profile
   says it won't relocate.
7. **A question with a condition on the applicant** ("If you are a current or
   former government employee, …?") is answered only when the condition holds.
   False → the option saying it does not apply, or blank. Unknown → blank.
   Hypotheticals ("If you are offered the position, …") hold.
8. **A required list whose ONLY option is an acknowledgement is answered with
   it.** This includes Anthropic's "Agreement to Arbitrate" ("I understand and
   agree to the terms…"), a waiver of the right to sue. That follows from "answer
   every question" and the form offers nothing else, but it is a legal agreement
   made on the user's behalf, so **you may want it excluded** (one regex in
   `defaultAnswers.ts`, `ACK_OPTION`).
9. **No test scores on the profile → "Did not take / Do not recall"** when the
   list offers it (SpaceX's SAT/ACT/GRE). It claims nothing. A free-text score
   box stays blank.
10. **U.S. export-control status is inferred only from US work authorization.**
    Not authorized in the US means none of citizen / permanent resident / refugee
    / asylee / DACA (each of those may work there), so "Other" / "None of the
    above" / "Foreign person". Nothing said about the US → blank.
11. **"Open to relocation?" answered with a list of cities → the job's own
    city** when the applicant is willing to relocate; "No" (or the remote
    alternative for a Remote preference) when not.
12. **Backend scope widened.** The new fields needed `backend/routers/profile.py`
   and `fill.py` (no migration: they live in `user_settings.prefilled_answers`
   under exact keys, never mined from other answers). The overnight run was
   extension-only; today's request required the web app and backend too.

### New profile answers (no mapping can supply these)

`authorizedUS`, `authorizedCanada` (Yes/No), `howDidYouHear`,
`expectedGraduation` (a month, `YYYY-MM`) and `gpa`. They are in the extension
panel (Preferences), the web Profile page, the backend profile API and the AI
fill context. Onboarding asks the two authorization questions (Role step) and the
expected graduation month (Experience step), and saves only what was answered (a
blank stays "not answered", never "No"). The option lists are twins pinned by
tests on both sides (`SCREENING_CHOICES` ⇄ `SCREENING_OPTIONS`).
What they unlock: "authorized to work in the US?" for a Canadian (before:
always blank), "When do you graduate?" with month-range options ("January - June
2027", "Spring 2027", "December 2026 - November 2027"), GPA buckets, and the
user's real channel instead of the default.

### Bugs found on real pages today, each fixed with a regression test

**Wrong answers written (the serious ones):**
1. **"No sponsorship needed" for a US job from a Canadian not authorized in the
   US** (`22f7628`). The general "requires sponsorship: No" (meant for Canada)
   beat the explicit "authorized in the US: No" for every US question: Hermeus
   got "No, I do not require sponsorship" for "…employment in the USA?", and
   Robinhood, ZipRecruiter, Twitch, Mindex, Palantir and Anthropic got "No". This
   bug came in with the new per-country field (`15ddffc`) and was caught by the
   complete-profile round before it shipped anywhere. Now: not authorized there →
   sponsorship needed there; an unscoped question with the job's country unknown
   stays blank for such an applicant; "require sponsorship … to legally work in
   the U.S." is a sponsorship question, not an authorization one.
2. **"If you are a current or former government employee, have you recused
   yourself…?" answered "No"** (ActioNet, `7f217c1`), which reads as an unrecused
   conflict. The form offered "I am not a current or former government
   employee". Conditional questions now evaluate their condition first.
3. **"…what sponsorship would you require?" got "Canadian citizen"** (Brex,
   `7f217c1`): the type of sponsorship is the applicant's to say; now blank.
4. **"Date Available" typed as "05 mon yyyy"** (BambooHR, `3702db9`): its Fabric
   date picker wants "03 May 2027" and mangled our "05/03/2027".
5. **A graduation month became a day** (Ramp's Ashby picker got "04/01/2027",
   `3702db9`). The day is unknown, so a day-precise picker stays blank.
6. **"Cisgender man" could be picked for a cisgender woman** listed after it
   (`d4505e3`); identity and gender must now both match.
7. **"Relocation assistance?" answered Yes**, **"currently enrolled OR graduated"
   answered No for graduates**, and **"a university" read as a school name**
   (`ce65496`, `7f217c1`).
8. **A dropdown counted as filled when it was not** (`7f65ee4`). An open list's
   highlighted option (`aria-activedescendant`) was read as the selection, so
   SpaceX's "Employment History" was skipped as "already showing the answer",
   reported as written, and confirmed by the end-of-fill check. The page held
   nothing. This could hit any react-select left open with the answer
   highlighted.
9. **"Have you held H-1B status…?" answered as a sponsorship question** (Yes,
   Twitch; `b7e71e1`).
10. **Blind round on 22 postings never seen before** (`1ee0260`), complete
    profile, 9 wrong writes:
    - "Preferred first and last name" → last name only.
    - "enrolled in a PhD program?" → Yes for a bachelor's student.
    - "any impediments to traveling internationally?" → Yes.
    - "If you have under 2 years…" → "N/A - I have more than 2 years" (she has 1.4).
    - "1–2 years of experience" → NO.
    - "school, program and expected month/year" → "2027".
    - Arc'teryx sponsorship → Yes for a job in Canada. The job's country was
      carried over from the previous Lever posting: every Lever company shares
      one host. Carry-over now requires the same job's URL path.
    - Rippling "Current company" → the first job (sequential ids "field-31"
      read as row 31).
    - A US-citizenship requirement that resolved to "Canada". It was blank only
      because no option matched.

    All 9 are fixed with tests that fail on the old code.
11. **Regression runs of the pinned suite** found three more:
    - ZipRecruiter: "What school are you currently attending / did you graduate
      from?" → school plus graduation date. The verb "graduate" is not a date
      question.
    - Ashby (Ramp, Superhuman): a disabled End Date read "October 2027". Ticking
      "Still Student?" disables End Date, and a year written first was left
      beside a month the page picked. A current student's End Date is now left
      to the page (`b455627`).
12. **Read-through of my own new rules** (`93966d7`, `4004008`):
    - A lone "Yes" option would have been taken as an acknowledgement ("Have you
      applied before? [Yes]").
    - "Professional Certification [Yes/No]" would have been read as consent.
    - "travel with no restrictions" would have been an obstacle question.
    - Striveworks' "12+ weeks from offer acceptance" was right only by luck: the
      option matcher read the start date's year (2027) as a number of weeks. A
      start next week would have landed there too.

**Blank answers the profile could give (fixed):** Brex's "authorized to work in
the stated location" (the job's place is now read from the page around an
embedded form, `bd01bfe`); Greenhouse/Ashby education end month, "Still
Student?" and Ashby's unlabeled year selects (`a167849`); citizenship country
after the new per-country answers (`22f7628`); relocation answered with a list
of cities (the job's city), "a Twitch employee", "legally eligible to begin
employment", employment history asked through its options, US export-control
status, graduate GPA "Other/Not Applicable", SAT "Did not take/Do not recall",
"how you heard" / "how did you connect" / an unlabeled channel list, single-option
acknowledgements (Anthropic's arbitration agreement), Anthropic's "AI Policy"
Yes, SMS consent asked through options, "No" typed into "Were you referred? If
so, who?", "join as an intern" start date (`d4505e3`); languages checklist,
"Other" for an unlisted major, the disability form's signature date (`93d19b5`);
a current student's "Still Student?" and Superhuman's graduation radios
(`b7e71e1`); "in the country that you are located", "at least 18 years or
older", "previously worked for this organization", "how did you FIRST hear",
preferred start dates offered as dates, "living in the US or Canada?", the time
zone, SMS "via text", "I understand…" acknowledgement boxes, future-job opt-ins,
and the job's country implied by the form's own work-auth questions (`1ee0260`);
start-time spans ("Over a month from offer"), Ashby's gender boxes ("Woman"),
and a stated channel offered several ways (`4004008`, `926f39a`).

**Not a gap:** Workable's `#city` / `#postcode` / `#country` are `aria-hidden`,
`tabindex=-1` helper inputs, not questions. Filling hidden inputs is what
blocked Workday's submit before (overnight bug list), so they stay empty.

### Test results

- **Extension unit suite:** 1411/1411 in 129 files (1331 in 128 at the start of
  the day). Every bug above has a test that fails on the code before its fix. I
  checked each one by swapping in the old file and running it.
- **Web app:** profile parity + settings 19/19, onboarding (SetupWizard) 13/13.
  The new onboarding and Profile fields rendered in a real browser at 13
  viewports (responsive audit: 0 high, 0 medium findings).
- **Backend:** profile + fill-profile tests 40 passed (run isolated, see
  overnight notes).
- **Real-extension e2e, final build (`results/final-1`):**
  - **Regression suite: 64/64 cases (42 live pages), 825/825 checks**, scored at
    run time against pins set before the run.
  - **Two new committed live rounds:** `real-live-complete.mjs` (18 pages,
    complete profile) and `real-live-fresh.mjs` (22 new postings). 40/40 against
    pins taken from that same run, so that number is a baseline, not a test. The
    pins were checked against the earlier reviewed run (`results/all-2`), where
    every write was read by hand. The final run differed from it only by the
    reviewed improvements and one intermittent blank.
  - The earlier reviewed run, re-scored against the final regression pins:
    63/64. The miss: Twitch's Degree dropdown left blank once (Greenhouse's
    async dropdowns drop occasionally; blank, never wrong).
- **Extension panel and web Profile page:** screenshots show the five new
  answers in the panel's "Your Autofill Information → Preference" (filled from
  the profile) and as rows on the web Profile page (responsive audit: 0 high, 0
  medium).

### Needs you / needs manual verification (today)

**Your decisions**
1. **Anthropic's arbitration agreement** is now accepted on the user's behalf:
   a required list whose only option is "I understand and agree…" (decision 8
   above). Say if you want legal waivers excluded.
2. **"I have never held H-1B status" is a default** for profiles that name no
   US visa; "Did not take / Do not recall" for SAT/ACT/GRE; "Other" for an
   unlisted major. Each is the answer that claims nothing, and each is easy to
   reverse.
3. **Rippling picks its phone country from the browser locale.** This test
   machine's Chromium runs en-GB, so it shows "+44 GB" (seen with no extension
   loaded). A user on en-US or en-CA gets "+1", so this is not a real-user
   problem, and the extension never overwrites a pre-filled value (overnight
   decision 8). Tell me if your users' locales vary enough to need a
   dial-code exception.

**Needs manual verification**
- **Deploy together.** The new profile answers are saved through the backend's
  profile API (`profile.py`, `fill.py`). Until that backend is deployed, prod
  ignores the unknown keys, so answers entered in the panel, the Profile page
  or onboarding will not persist. Ship backend and web app in the same push.
- **Web onboarding and Profile page:** rendered in a real browser at phone and
  laptop sizes (responsive audit: 0 high, 0 medium; the radios and the month
  input work), and covered by unit tests. A real save against the backend was
  not run (no deployed backend with the new keys).
- **Your installed extension is the old build** (prod report 183 from Brex had
  an empty extension version). `cd chrome-extension && node build.mjs`, then
  reload the unpacked extension.
- **Intermittent, not fixed:** Hermeus's Lever location typeahead stayed blank
  once (filled in the previous run); Greenhouse's async School dropdown
  (Robinhood) as before. (SpaceX's GRE was listed here as a dropdown that
  opened too late. Wrong: it was blank on every run, because its two "did not
  take" options tied. Fixed in the real-profile run, see the top section.)
- **Still blank by design:** essays, opinions, skill-specific questions
  ("experience with AI?", years of Roblox Studio), the applicant's
  extracurriculars, interview-recording consent, sponsorship TYPE.
  (Accommodation requests and "local to Chicago for summer 2027?" were on this
  list; the real-profile run answers them from stated facts now, see the top
  section.)

# Overnight run: deterministic autofill (2026-10-03)

Branch: `night/deterministic-autofill` (local only, NOT pushed, NOT deployed).
Scope: `chrome-extension/` only. AI is out of credits, so every number below is
measured with the backend's AI pass returning nothing.

> Status: DONE for the night. Everything below was run and observed unless it
> is listed under "Needs manual verification" (section 5).

**TL;DR.** With the AI returning nothing, the extension now answers from the
profile alone and leaves the rest blank. On 64 real-extension cases (42 of
them live application pages) it passes **774/774 checks with zero wrong
writes** (four of those checks accept a blank; see section 4). Twenty-four of
the live pages were drawn fresh after the main fixes and reviewed blind: the
first twelve showed 14 wrong values on 6 pages, the next twelve (after fixing
those) 1 wrong write on 1 page. All fixed and pinned, but expect a few more on
pages nobody has looked at.
The `main` build, re-scored on the 40 of those cases that predate the
held-out round, scored 387/478 and wrote 13 invented answers ("authorized to
work in the US? Yes" for a Canadian citizen, among others) plus 14 wrong
values; the branch passes all 40. Nothing was pushed or deployed. Section 5
lists what needs you.

**How to run it yourself** (from `chrome-extension/`):
- Unit suite: `node node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs run` (`npm test` exits 1 with no
  output in some shells; run vitest directly).
- Real-extension e2e: `node build.mjs && node test/e2e/run.mjs` (all 66 cases,
  about 20 min, opens a Chromium window; the two live SmartRecruiters cases
  time out while DataDome blocks this machine). `--filter live` / `framework` /
  `synthetic` / `inputs` / an ATS name / a case id narrows it; `--report-only` exits 0 for
  measurement runs. `E2E_DEBUG=1` prints the extension's console per case.
- Older harness and probes: `npm run test:browser`, `npm run test:flow`,
  `npm run test:workday-account`, `npm run test:workday-gate`,
  `npm run test:workday-churn`, `npm run test:driver`, `npm run test:click-shadow`,
  `npm run test:extension`.

## 1. Testing infrastructure

**What worked (no fallback needed):** real Chromium + the real extension.
Playwright 1.61.1 and Chromium 1228 were already installed. This is Windows, so
there is no xvfb: Chromium runs HEADFUL natively (a window opens), with
`--load-extension=dist --disable-extensions-except=dist`. Nothing failed to
install. (`HEADLESS=1` switches to `--headless=new`, which also loads
extensions.)

New harness, `chrome-extension/test/e2e/`:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fakeApi.mjs` | Local stand-in for the Tailrd backend. The extension is pointed at it through its own settings, so the shipped bundle is untouched. Serves the profile sync, answers `/api/fill` the way a credit-less AI does (no answers, `ai_error`), turns diagnostic capture ON and records every telemetry report. |
| `harness.mjs` | Launches Chromium with `dist/`, seeds config/auth, serves pages at their REAL ATS URLs by route interception (so site adapters match), presses the panel's own Autofill button, follows the flow's progress beats until it parks, then dumps the page. |
| `dumpFields.mjs` | Reads EVERY field's final value and type from the page DOM (open shadow roots, every frame). This is the ground truth, independent of what the extension believes it wrote. |
| `evaluate.mjs` | Scores a case: expected values per field, PLUS every field that changed without an expectation is an UNEXPECTED write (the wrong-kind / invented-answer check). Framework pages also assert the framework's own model state. |
| `run.mjs` | `node build.mjs && node test/e2e/run.mjs [--filter x] [--report-only]`: per-case and per-ATS report, JSON in `test/e2e/results/` (gitignored). |
| `capture.mjs` | Captured the real application pages (below) from jobs in the app. |

Safety: in live mode only reads leave the browser. GET/HEAD/OPTIONS go out,
plus GraphQL POSTs whose operation is a `query` (Ashby renders from those).
Every other request is aborted (submits, uploads, mutations, autosave,
analytics beacons). No form was submitted, nothing uploaded, no account created.

Test corpora:
- **Live real pages** (`cases/real-live.mjs`): application forms from active jobs
  in prod `scraped_jobs` (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, SmartRecruiters,
  BambooHR, Jobvite), with a realistic sparse profile (one location string,
  "Canadian citizen", co-op in progress). BambooHR is also run the way a user
  does it: open the form, press Autofill a second later
  (`live-bamboo-nexthop-user-opened`). One Greenhouse form is embedded the way
  career sites do it: an employer page with a cross-origin `grnhse_iframe`
  (`cases/real-live-embedded.mjs`).
- **Same live pages, other applicants** (`cases/real-live-profiles.mjs`): a US
  F-1 student with a structured Cambridge, MA address (Workable, Jobvite), and a
  profile whose whole address is one street line (BambooHR).
- **Held-out live pages** (`cases/real-live-heldout.mjs`): two rounds of 12
  postings drawn at random from prod `scraped_jobs` AFTER the fixes above,
  from companies not in the corpus (round 1: Ashby 4, Greenhouse 4, Lever 3,
  Workable 1; round 2: Ashby 4, Greenhouse 4, Lever 4). Each first pass was
  blind: no expectations, every write reviewed by hand. Round 1 found bugs
  #30-#35; round 2 (after those were fixed) found one, #36. All pinned.
- **Inputs** (`cases/inputs.mjs`): date inputs (native `date`, split M/D/Y,
  masked text) and a real résumé file upload, checked in the page.
- **Captured real pages** (`test/fixtures/real/`): rendered DOM of those pages, for
  the jsdom regression suite (`test/realPages.test.ts`), 1.9 MB after trimming CSS.
- **Framework pages** (`cases/frameworks.mjs`): React 18 controlled inputs (incl. a
  phone mask and a re-render on every blur), Vue 3 `v-model` (`.lazy`, `.trim`,
  `.number`, name-less radios), AngularJS 1.8 `ng-model` (`updateOn: 'blur'`,
  `ng-options`). Asserts the value registered in the FRAMEWORK STATE, not just the
  DOM. Libraries vendored in `test/e2e/vendor/` (MIT).
- **Synthetic ATS fixtures** (`cases/synthetic.mjs`): the repo's 16 jsdom fixture
  builders, bundled and served on each ATS's real host. This is the only coverage
  for Workday, iCIMS, Taleo and SuccessFactors (see section 5).

The pre-existing in-page harness (`npm run test:browser`) still runs; it had 8 of
19 scenarios failing on clean `main` (stale expectations, see section 2).

## 2. Bugs found and fixed (each with its regression test)

Every item was reproduced first (test failing, or a wrong value on a live page),
then fixed. "Live" = observed with the real extension on a real ATS page tonight.

| # | Bug | Where seen | Regression test |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Work authorization was country-blind**: "Authorized to work in Canada" (or "Canadian citizen") answered "Are you legally authorized to work in the **United States**?" **Yes**. Same for sponsorship. | Live: Greenhouse ×2, Workable | `questionResolver.test.ts` "work authorization, country-aware"; `realPages.test.ts` Greenhouse/Ashby/Workable; `workday.test.ts` "this country" |
| 2 | Abstained legal questions still went to the backend, whose rule pass answers "authorized to work?" Yes and "sponsorship?" No **unconditionally**. They now never leave the device. | Code read (`backend/routers/fill.py` `_raw_rule_based_answer`) | `realPages.test.ts` (`deviceAbstained`) |
| 3 | **Ashby radio questions took the PREVIOUS question's label** (`<fieldset><label for=…>` with no `<legend>`): "Do you think AI will take over the world?" was read as work authorization and answered **Yes**. | Live: Ashby | `realPages.test.ts` Ashby |
| 4 | **Lever radio questions had no label** (question in a sibling `.application-label`): labelled with the input's `name`, never recognized. | Live: Lever | `realPages.test.ts` Lever |
| 5 | City got the whole "Toronto, ON, Canada"; a bare "Address" next to City/Postal got the location string. | Live: BambooHR, Jobvite | `addressFields.test.ts`, `realPages.test.ts` BambooHR/Jobvite |
| 6 | "Do you anticipate challenges clearing a background check?" got the **degree title**; "Where did you complete your undergraduate degree?" got the degree title instead of the school; "If 'Other' selected for School Name…" got the school. | Live: Lever, Greenhouse | `realPages.test.ts`, `questionResolver.test.ts` |
| 7 | "Let the company know about your interest working there" (textarea) got the **employer's name**. | Live: SmartRecruiters | `realPages.test.ts` SmartRecruiters |
| 8 | A Lever commute question ("…the Toronto office located at… Are you able to…") was answered as a residence question (Yes). | Live: Lever | `questionResolver.test.ts` "applicant must be the subject" |
| 9 | Option matching ignored negation: "I am not a protected veteran" tied 100% with "I am a protected veteran" and option ORDER decided. Also: "no" matched inside "not", ties went to the first option, a number on a bucket boundary went to the first bucket, "Over 6 years" was unparsed, a place name could land on a Yes/No option through a shared word. | Old harness tie; unit repro | `optionMatchStrict.test.ts` (14) |
| 10 | **The page observer watched the panel's own shadow root**: every panel repaint caused a rescan, which repainted the panel. A rescan every 500 ms on every page while the panel was open. | Live logs (hundreds of repaints per page) | `observePage.test.ts` |
| 11 | **Lever's location typeahead never stuck** (it clears an entry not picked from its list). Now types the city and clicks Lever's own suggestion, matched as a PLACE ("Toronto, ON, CAN"). | Live: Lever ×3 | `leverAdapter.test.ts` (live suggestion list verbatim) |
| 12 | **Comboboxes inside web components**: IDREFs were resolved with `document.getElementById`, which cannot see into shadow roots. SmartRecruiters' City menu lives in the parent component's shadow root. | Live: SmartRecruiters | `comboboxShadowControls.test.ts` |
| 13 | **Radios with no `name`** (Vue `v-model`, hand-rolled React) were one-option groups that no answer could select. | Vue 3 page | `namelessRadios.test.ts` |
| 14 | A `groupIndex` parsed from an id ("…-labeled-radio-0") disabled question shapes outside employment/education rows. | Ashby jsdom | `realPages.test.ts` Ashby |
| 15 | Experience-row "Start Date" fields were briefly read as availability questions during the work (caught by the existing suite before commit, fixed: availability needs explicit wording). | `experienceFields.test.ts`, `greenhouseLyftScan.test.ts` | existing tests |
| 16 | **Options past the 60th were dropped as "not offered"**: the scan-time gate checked proposals against the panel's 60-option copy. Every native country select with a full list dropped "United States" (position ~235); Lever's picker dropped "University of Waterloo". Pre-existing. | Live: Lever | `longSelects.test.ts` |
| 17 | **select2 / chosen selects**: the hidden native `<select>` was skipped (hidden + aria-hidden) and the styled proxy fought. Now the native select is filled, labelled by its question, and the proxy is ignored. | Live: Lever | `realPages.test.ts` "select2" |
| 18 | "Are you **able to work** from our Kepler office as required?" was answered as a work-authorization question (from citizenship). | Live: Lever | `questionResolver.test.ts` "'able to work'" |
| 19 | A phone "Country code" picker classified as the applicant's location. | Live: SmartRecruiters | `fieldMatcher.test.ts` "phone country code" |
| 20 | **Comboboxes built from web components**: options slotted into a shadow-DOM listbox were not found; option and selected-value text projected through `<slot>` read as empty; IDREFs into a sibling component's shadow root unresolved. SmartRecruiters' City and Country code never filled. | Live: SmartRecruiters | `comboboxShadowControls.test.ts` (5) |
| 21 | **Place suggestions matched by tokens**: "Toronto, OH, US" scored as a PERFECT match for "Toronto, ON, Canada" (short tokens dropped). City/location dropdowns now pick by place (city, region by code or name, country by name/ISO-2/ISO-3); ambiguous lists are refused. | Live: SmartRecruiters, Lever | `comboboxShadowControls.test.ts` placeHint, `leverAdapter.test.ts` |
| 22 | Material UI wraps native radios in `role="radiogroup"` elements; each was scanned as an empty ARIA group and logged a failed fill next to the native group that filled. | Live: BambooHR | `realPages.test.ts` "wrappers" |
| 23 | **Backend answers skipped the kind gate**: the backend's rule pass answers "city" for any label mentioning a location, which could put "Toronto" into a yes/no text question. Backend answers now pass the same gate. | Code + unit repro | `aiFillPlanner.test.ts` "must fit the field's kind" |
| 24 | Field of study "Applied Science in Mechatronics Engineering" (prefix list misses "of Applied Science"); "Bachelor's degree in progress" gave "progress" (pre-existing). | Live: Workable | `workdayFieldOfStudy.test.ts` |
| 25 | Workday application steps show no job location, so "authorized to work in this country?" could never be answered there. The job country now comes from Workday's URL slug (`/job/Cambridge-MA/…`) or is carried from the posting page. | Code read | `jobLocation.test.ts` |
| 26 | "Will you require relocation assistance or visa sponsorship?" would have been answered from the sponsorship half alone; "120k" salary into a number field gave 120. | Unit repro | `questionResolver.test.ts`, `fieldResolverKinds.test.ts` |
| 27 | **Rows the fill pass adds itself were never filled**: the pass clicks "Add education / experience" for the profile's entries, but only the ids picked at click time were written. | Live: Workable | `fillSelection.test.ts` |
| 28 | **A form the site still holds hidden was scanned as empty.** BambooHR keeps its form mounted inside a `display:none` box for 2.5-5 s after "Apply for This Job" (measured with a page-side probe). No node is added at the reveal, so the DOM-quiet wait passed at once, every control looked hidden, and the flow parked on an empty page: live-bamboo-nexthop failed about half of combined runs. Now waits (bounded, 10 s) while most of the page's typeable controls are mounted-but-hidden, and rescans as they render. | Live: BambooHR | `hiddenForm.test.ts` (7), `flowController.test.ts` "apply entry", live `live-bamboo-*`: 24/24 over 6 runs, then 20/20 over 5 on the final build |
| 29 | **Autofill silently did nothing** when no field was picked and no "Apply" button was visible, although the button is deliberately always live. Hit by anyone who opens a BambooHR form and presses Autofill within those 5 s. | Live: BambooHR | `overlayAutofillClick.test.ts` (fails on the old code), live `live-bamboo-nexthop-user-opened` |
| 30 | **A date picker re-parsed a partial date into a wrong day.** "What is your graduation date?" is a react-datepicker; the profile's graduation YEAR "2027" was typed in and the picker showed **12/31/2026** (`new Date("2027")` is UTC midnight, the evening before in Toronto). Date controls (native type, a format placeholder, or a known picker library) now take only a whole date, re-emitted in the control's format; otherwise blank. Backend answers too. | Held-out live: Ashby (Ramp) | `dateControl.test.ts` (7), `fieldResolverKinds.test.ts` date controls, `aiFillPlanner.test.ts` |
| 31 | **A bare year inside several options was a coin flip**: "2027" picked "December 2027" over "January - June 2027" for having fewer words. A bare number in several options is refused. | Held-out live: Ashby (Superhuman) | `optionMatchStrict.test.ts` "bare year" |
| 32 | **Greenhouse education rows got the first JOB's dates**: the education block has its own start/end month and year (`.education--date-container`), which classified as employment dates. End date = graduation (a bare year fills only the year); start date (unknown) stays blank. Older Greenhouse markup wraps EMPLOYMENT in `.education-experience-block`, so a wrapper naming both is ignored. | Held-out live: Greenhouse (Twitch, Astranis) | `educationRowDates.test.ts` (4; 3 fail without the fix) |
| 33 | **"Mechanical Engineering" for a Mechatronics student**: the matcher counted any shared 5-letter stem as the same word. A variant now differs only by an ending of at most 3 letters (Canada/Canadian/Canadien still match). | Held-out live: Greenhouse (Astranis) | `optionMatchStrict.test.ts` "sharing a stem" |
| 34 | **"High School Name" got "University of Waterloo"**, and "Year of High School Graduation" the university's 2027. High-school detail questions abstain (a yes/no about a diploma is left to the education-level rules). | Held-out live: Lever (Palantir) | `questionResolver.test.ts`, `fieldResolverKinds.test.ts` high school |
| 35 | **The react-select / Workday driver had its own looser matcher**: substring containment, first containing option wins. A graduation year committed "December 2026 - November 2027" though "December 2027 - November 2028" fits too, and "male" sits inside "female". `matchOption` moved to `optionMatch.ts` (pure) and the page-world driver now uses it. | Held-out live: Greenhouse (ZipRecruiter) | `mainWorldDriver.test.ts` (fails on the old matcher) |
| 36 | **A demographic-data consent checkbox was ticked for the user**: "By checking this box, I consent to Robinhood collecting, storing, and processing my responses to the demographic data surveys above", for an applicant who answered none of them. It classifies as a demographic field at high confidence, so the consent "yes" passed the selection gate. A sensitive box now carries only the user's own answer. | Held-out round 2 live: Greenhouse (Robinhood) | `checkboxIntent.test.ts`, `fieldResolverKinds.test.ts` (fails without the fix) |

Old in-page harness (`test/browser/run.mjs`): its résumé-upload scenario failed only
because the harness did not `await` the now-async `injectResumeFile` (harness bug,
fixed). With the product fixes above it is **19/19** (was 11/19 on clean `main`).
The other real-browser probes (`flow-probe`, the three Workday account/churn
probes, `react-select-driver`, `click-shadow-probe`, `load-extension`) all pass.

New test files: `optionMatchStrict`, `profileFacts`, `questionResolver`,
`realPages` (32 assertions on captured real pages), `namelessRadios`,
`longSelects`, `comboboxShadowControls`, `jobLocation`, `fieldResolverKinds`,
`fillSelection`, `hiddenForm`, `overlayAutofillClick`, `dateControl`,
`educationRowDates`, plus additions to `leverAdapter`, `observePage`,
`fieldMatcher`, `aiFillPlanner`, `workdayFieldOfStudy`, `workday`,
`flowController`, `mainWorldDriver`. Unit suite: **1303 passing in 127 files**
(was 1101).

Harness bugs found and fixed along the way (not product bugs): clicking Autofill
before an SPA form rendered, waiting out the full timeout when a fill errored,
treating the end of a zero-field entry page as the end of the flow, an ATS draft
(Workable restores the previous applicant's answers from site storage) leaking
into the next case (storage and cookies are now cleared per case), and the
harness clicking BambooHR's "Apply" on top of the extension's own click, which
toggled the form shut.

## 3. Decisions made on your behalf

1. **Only HIGH-confidence inferences fill.** Medium/low are computed but never
   written. Where the profile does not settle a question (US work authorization for
   a Canadian citizen, "this country" when the job's country is unknown, highest
   education while a degree is in progress), the field stays blank AND is kept
   from the backend. Conservative: blanks are cheap, wrong legal answers are not.
2. **Questions without a country** ("Are you authorized to work in this
   country?") are answered for the JOB's country, read from the posting
   (schema.org JobPosting JSON-LD, then the ATS location line) and carried from
   the posting page to later application steps on the same host. Unknown job
   country → blank.
3. **The applicant's own sponsorship answer** applies to unscoped questions and to
   countries their status covers, never to a country they never mentioned.
4. **A single unindexed School/Degree/Graduation field** now means the PRIMARY
   education (in progress, else most recent graduation), not entry [0]. Test
   updated (`fieldMatcher.test.ts`).
5. **City/Country/Region/Postal are derived from one location or address
   string** ("Toronto, ON, Canada" → Toronto / Ontario / Canada). A bare
   "Toronto" stays MEDIUM (not filled as a country): there is a London, Ontario.
6. **Years of experience** = merged employment spans (overlaps counted once),
   high only when every row has dates. Domain-qualified questions ("software
   development experience") answer only when every job title is in that domain;
   skill-qualified ("experience with Kubernetes") never.
7. **Consent / attestation checkboxes: CORRECTED, and the policy needs you.**
   An earlier version of this note said consent boxes are never ticked because
   the selection gate blocks them. That was wrong. `checkboxIntent.ts`
   (commit d5d087f, Jobright parity) proposes "yes" for clear consent wording,
   and whether the box is then ticked depends on how confidently its label
   happens to classify: most consent boxes classify as unknown and stay
   unticked, but one that also matches a confident category gets ticked.
   Robinhood's demographic-data consent was ticked that way (bug #36). Tonight
   I fixed only the sensitive case: a demographic (EEO) box is never ticked for
   its wording. For every other consent box the behavior is unchanged and
   inconsistent; pick one policy (tick all clear application consent like
   Jobright, or none) and make the gate enforce it.
8. **Pre-filled fields are never overwritten**, even when the site guessed them
   (Workable fills Address from IP geolocation). Unchanged behavior.
9. Real-page fixtures are committed with CSS/SVG stripped (1.9 MB); the HAR
   recordings (203 MB) stay local and gitignored.
10. Nothing pushed, nothing deployed, no backend changes (the backend's
    unconditional rule answers are listed in section 5 instead).
11. **What the backend still gets.** Only abstentions on legal status (work
    authorization, sponsorship, citizenship, age) are withheld from the backend.
    Essays, opinions and skill-specific questions still go to it, so they work
    again the day the AI has credits. Every backend answer must now pass the same
    kind gate as an on-device one.
12. **Place pickers choose a place or nothing.** With several "Toronto"
    suggestions and no region/country to tell them apart, nothing is picked.
13. **Options are snapped at scan time.** A select's proposal is now the exact
    option text it will select ("I am not a veteran"), so the panel shows what
    will actually be written.
14. **Waiting for a hidden form is bounded at 10 s** and only happens on the
    page an "Apply" entry click just opened, or on an Autofill click that picked
    nothing; and there only while the page's typeable controls are mostly
    mounted-but-hidden AND (nothing is fillable yet, OR at most two controls are
    rendered). Ordinary wizard steps never wait: a wizard that keeps its other
    steps mounted but hidden would otherwise stall on pages with nothing to
    fill, such as a review page. Pages whose form is not hidden pay nothing.
15. **An Autofill click with nothing picked now always runs** (fill pass, then
    the flow: open the form, wait for it, or say "No application form found on
    this page"). Before, it returned silently. The panel's own comment says the
    button "stays live whenever a profile is loaded", so a dead click was the bug.
16. **The panel covering BambooHR's Apply button (section 5) was NOT changed.**
    Moving or shrinking the panel is a layout decision with knock-on effects on
    every site; recorded for you instead.
17. **Date controls get whole dates only.** A picker that does not state its
    format is assumed MM/DD/YYYY (react-datepicker's default, and what Ashby
    shows). A graduation year never goes into a day-precise picker: the
    profile does not know the day.
18. **A broader parent option is acceptable, a sibling is not.** With no
    "Mechatronics" option, "Engineering" may be picked (it is true);
    "Mechanical Engineering" may not (it is a different discipline).
19. **High-school questions stay blank.** Profiles hold post-secondary
    education only.

## 4. Per-ATS pass rates

Every number here is the real packaged extension in Chromium, pressing the
panel's own Autofill button, with the backend's AI returning nothing. "checks" =
expected-value checks (a value where one is expected, a BLANK where the right
answer is to abstain) plus one failure per unexpected write. All read back from
the page DOM (and the framework's own state on the framework pages).

### Final: branch HEAD `c0b43f3`, 64 cases

| ATS | cases ok | checks | rate | fills ok | correct abstentions | wrong writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ashby | 11/11 | 83/83 | 100% | 51/51 | 32/32 | 0 |
| bamboohr | 5/5 | 60/60 | 100% | 38/38 | 22/22 | 0 |
| greenhouse | 13/13 | 211/211 | 100% | 128/128 | 83/83 | 0 |
| jobvite | 3/3 | 66/66 | 100% | 24/24 | 42/42 | 0 |
| lever | 11/11 | 147/147 | 100% | 81/81 | 66/66 | 0 |
| workable | 5/5 | 70/70 | 100% | 47/47 | 23/23 | 0 |
| smartrecruiters (synthetic) | 1/1 | 3/3 | 100% | 3/3 | 0/0 | 0 |
| workday | 2/2 | 21/21 | 100% | 18/18 | 3/3 | 0 |
| icims | 1/1 | 9/9 | 100% | 9/9 | 0/0 | 0 |
| taleo | 1/1 | 9/9 | 100% | 9/9 | 0/0 | 0 |
| successfactors | 1/1 | 9/9 | 100% | 9/9 | 0/0 | 0 |
| adp | 1/1 | 9/9 | 100% | 9/9 | 0/0 | 0 |
| breezy | 1/1 | 5/5 | 100% | 5/5 | 0/0 | 0 |
| bullhorn | 1/1 | 4/4 | 100% | 4/4 | 0/0 | 0 |
| rippling | 1/1 | 4/4 | 100% | 4/4 | 0/0 | 0 |
| framework (React 18 / Vue 3 / AngularJS) | 3/3 | 49/49 | 100% | 46/46 | 3/3 | 0 |
| inputs (dates, résumé upload) | 2/2 | 9/9 | 100% | 9/9 | 0/0 | 0 |
| smoke | 1/1 | 6/6 | 100% | 6/6 | 0/0 | 0 |
| **total** | **64/64** | **774/774** | **100%** | | | **0** |

Failure kinds on this run: 0 left blank where a value was expected, 0 wrong
values, 0 invented answers, 0 stray writes.

- **Read the 100% with this caveat.** Four checks accept "the right answer OR
  blank" (a blank there is a miss, never a wrong write), and all four came out
  blank in this run: Greenhouse School on ZipRecruiter and on Robinhood (the
  intermittent in section 5), "Are you currently a Twitch employee?" (No would
  be right), and Workable's "Based in Austin, TX?" (NO would be right).
- Live real pages: 42 cases, 606/606 checks. Greenhouse 12 (incl. the
  cross-origin embed), Lever 10, Ashby 10, Workable 4, BambooHR 4, Jobvite 2.
  Workday, iCIMS, Taleo, SuccessFactors, ADP, Breezy, Bullhorn and Rippling
  are synthetic fixtures served on each ATS's real host (section 5 says why).
- **Live SmartRecruiters is not in this run**: both postings answer this
  machine with HTTP 403 + a DataDome captcha (re-checked with `curl` before the
  run). Earlier the same night both passed 100%; in the run on `c7fca08` they
  were the only failures (477/499 with them, 477/477 without).
- Stability: BambooHR, the one race-prone site, passed 20/20 case runs on
  `c7fca08` (5 combined runs) and 24/24 on the commit before it.

### Held-out pages: blind first passes, then fixed

Two rounds of twelve postings drawn at random from prod `scraped_jobs` after
the main fixes, from companies not in the corpus, each first run with NO
expectations and every write reviewed by hand (`cases/real-live-heldout.mjs`
now pins them):

- **Round 1 (Ashby 4, Greenhouse 4, Lever 3, Workable 1): 14 wrong values on 6
  of 12 pages.** Ramp's graduation date picker 12/31/2026; Superhuman's and
  ZipRecruiter's graduation option chosen from a bare year that fits two;
  Twitch's and Astranis's education start/end dates set to the first job's (8
  values); Astranis's Discipline "Mechanical Engineering"; Palantir's "High
  School Name" and its graduation year. Bugs #30-#35.
- **Round 2 (Ashby 4, Greenhouse 4, Lever 4), after those fixes: 1 wrong write
  on 1 of 12 pages**: Robinhood's demographic-data consent checkbox ticked.
  Bug #36.
- Everything else written on those pages was right, including what the night's
  work targeted: US work authorization and sponsorship left blank for a
  Canadian on every US posting, dial code "+1", citizenship "Canada",
  "previously employed by Amazon / Figma / Robinhood?" answered No from the
  work history, legal-name / preferred-name cards on Lever, current company
  "Kinaxis", Lever and Ashby location pickers "Toronto", arbitration
  agreements and SMS consents left alone.
- After the fixes: round 1 12/12 cases, 172/172 checks; round 2 12/12, 125/125.

### Before/after on identical cases and expectations

The baseline build (`b9aebcc`, `main` when the night started) re-scored with
`E2E_EXT_DIR` against the SAME cases and expectations, the 40 cases that
existed before the held-out round (the branch column is `c7fca08`; `c0b43f3`
passes the same 40). Live SmartRecruiters is left out of both columns
(DataDome).

| ATS | baseline cases | baseline checks | branch cases | branch checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| adp | 0/1 | 8/9 (89%) | 1/1 | 9/9 (100%) |
| ashby | 2/3 | 17/19 (89%) | 3/3 | 19/19 (100%) |
| bamboohr | 1/5 | 46/60 (77%) | 5/5 | 60/60 (100%) |
| breezy | 1/1 | 5/5 (100%) | 1/1 | 5/5 (100%) |
| bullhorn | 1/1 | 4/4 (100%) | 1/1 | 4/4 (100%) |
| framework | 0/3 | 31/49 (63%) | 3/3 | 49/49 (100%) |
| greenhouse | 1/5 | 66/77 (86%) | 5/5 | 77/77 (100%) |
| icims | 0/1 | 8/9 (89%) | 1/1 | 9/9 (100%) |
| inputs | 1/2 | 6/9 (67%) | 2/2 | 9/9 (100%) |
| jobvite | 1/3 | 59/66 (89%) | 3/3 | 66/66 (100%) |
| lever | 1/4 | 49/59 (83%) | 4/4 | 59/59 (100%) |
| rippling | 1/1 | 4/4 (100%) | 1/1 | 4/4 (100%) |
| smartrecruiters (synthetic) | 1/1 | 3/3 (100%) | 1/1 | 3/3 (100%) |
| smoke | 1/1 | 6/6 (100%) | 1/1 | 6/6 (100%) |
| successfactors | 0/1 | 8/9 (89%) | 1/1 | 9/9 (100%) |
| taleo | 0/1 | 8/9 (89%) | 1/1 | 9/9 (100%) |
| workable | 1/4 | 42/60 (70%) | 4/4 | 59/59 (100%) |
| workday | 0/2 | 17/21 (81%) | 2/2 | 21/21 (100%) |
| **total** | **13/40** | **387/478 (81%)** | **40/40** | **477/477 (100%)** |

What the failures were:

| | left blank (value expected) | wrong value written | invented answer (blank expected) | stray write |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline `b9aebcc` | 63 | 14 | 13 | 1 |
| branch `c7fca08` | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

The baseline's 13 invented answers include "Are you legally authorized to work
in the United States?" **Yes** for a Canadian citizen (Greenhouse ×3, Workable)
and for an F-1 student (Workable, its radio and the ARIA twin), "Do you think AI will take over the
world?" **Yes**, "highest education: Bachelors" for a student whose degree is
in progress, and the degree title typed into a background-check question. Its
14 wrong values are the whole location string ("Toronto, ON, Canada",
"Ottawa, ON, Canada") in City fields, and the degree title where the school was

### Live pages through the night

The original 15 live cases, scored with the expectations as they stood at each
point (expectations were corrected during the night, e.g. Workable's
IP-prefilled Address, so the re-scored table above is the fair comparison).

| point | checks | cases |
|---|---|---|
| baseline `b9aebcc` | 170/226 (75%) | 1/15 |
| inference layer + kind gate | 185/228 (81%) | 1/15 |
| round 3 (labels, Lever, shadow listboxes) | 205/228 (90%) | 7/15 |
| round 4 (web components, place matching) | 215/226 (95%) | 10/15 |
| final `c7fca08` | 211/233 (91%); 211/211 (100%) without SmartRecruiters | 13/15; 13/13 |

### First measurement: `main` build (b9aebcc), before any change

Live pages only, SPARSE_CANADIAN profile, expectations as first written.

| ATS | cases ok | checks | rate | fills ok | correct abstentions | wrong writes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ashby | 1/2 | 13/15 | 87% | 5/6 | 8/9 | 0 |
| bamboohr | 0/2 | 16/28 | 57% | 5/14 | 11/14 | 0 |
| greenhouse | 0/3 | 44/52 | 85% | 23/28 | 21/24 | 0 |
| jobvite | 0/1 | 28/31 | 90% | 6/8 | 22/23 | 0 |
| lever | 0/3 | 43/53 | 81% | 13/22 | 30/31 | 0 |
| smartrecruiters | 0/2 | 6/20 | 30% | 0/14 | 6/6 | 0 |
| workable | 0/2 | 20/27 | 74% | 8/12 | 12/13 | 1 |
| **total** | **1/15** | **170/226** | **75%** | | | |

Wrong answers the baseline actually wrote on live pages (all now pinned by tests,
see section 2):
- "Are you legally authorized to work in the United States?" → **Yes** for a
  Canadian citizen (Greenhouse ×2, Workable). Country-blind.
- "Do you anticipate having any challenges with clearing a background check?"
  → the applicant's degree title (Lever).
- "Do you think AI will take over the world?" → **Yes** (Ashby).
- "If 'Other' selected for School Name, please indicate here" → the school (Greenhouse).
- "Where did you complete your undergraduate degree?" → the degree title, not the school.
- City → "Toronto, ON, Canada" (whole location string), Address → the location string (BambooHR).
- (Not our bug, recorded so nobody chases it: Workable's Address showed
  "Gatineau, Canada". Workable pre-fills that field from the visitor's IP
  geolocation; the capture taken with NO extension loaded already contains it.
  The extension leaves non-empty fields alone, by design.)

## 5. Needs you / needs manual verification

**Your decisions / actions**
1. **Review and merge** `night/deterministic-autofill` (26 commits on top of
   `b9aebcc`, the last one adding this file; local only, not pushed). Then
   `cd chrome-extension && node build.mjs` and **reload the unpacked
   extension** at chrome://extensions (Chrome caches it).
2. **Backend bug, not touched (out of scope tonight):**
   `backend/routers/fill.py::_raw_rule_based_answer` answers any "sponsorship"
   question "No", and any "authorized to work" / "18 or older" question "Yes",
   unconditionally. `answer_gate` only checks the POLARITY of the stored
   statement, never the country, so "Authorized to work in Canada" passes a
   "Yes" to "authorized to work in the United States?". The extension now keeps
   those questions away from the backend when it has abstained on them, but any
   other client of `/api/fill` still gets the guess. Recommend deleting those
   three rules (derived_facts already computes age from the DOB).
3. **Decision #7 needs your call**: consent checkboxes are ticked or not
   depending on incidental classification today (only the demographic case is
   fixed). Choose "tick clear application consent" or "never tick", and I would
   enforce it in `shared/selection.ts`.
4. **The panel covers the site's own Apply button on BambooHR** at 1366×900 (a
   very common laptop size). The auto-mounted panel is a 380 px overlay on the
   right, and BambooHR's "Apply for This Job" sits in the right column
   underneath it: a real pointer click lands on the panel. Our own Autofill
   clicks Apply programmatically, so the extension flow works, but a user who
   wants to open the form by hand has to close the panel first. Options: push
   the page left (margin on `<html>`) while the panel is open, start collapsed
   on job-description pages, or leave it. Not changed tonight (decision #16).
   Seen and measured with `elementFromPoint` on the live posting.

**Needs manual verification (I could not test these for real)**
- **Workday application steps.** The real form sits behind account creation, and
  creating accounts on employers' tenants is an outward action I did not take.
  Covered only by the synthetic fixtures (incl. shadow DOM) and the captured
  sign-in wall. The Workday-specific code paths (prompt dropdowns, date
  spinbuttons, "How did you hear" multiselect, Add-row sections) were not
  exercised against a live tenant tonight. The new URL-based job-country
  detection is unit-tested on real Workday URLs.
- **iCIMS and Taleo** application forms (login walls; the app has no active Taleo
  listings). Synthetic fixtures only. **SuccessFactors and ADP**: synthetic only.
- **SmartRecruiters**: both live pages passed 100% earlier in the night (City
  "Toronto, Ontario, Canada", dial code "+1"; ServiceNow again 12/12 in the
  second-to-last full run). By the final run both postings answer this machine
  with **HTTP 403 and a DataDome captcha page** (checked with a plain `curl` GET
  each), so their forms never render and every check reads as missing. That is
  bot protection reacting to repeated automated runs from one IP, not an
  extension failure. Re-check both by hand once from a normal browser.
- **Real profiles with unusual work-authorization text.** The parser handles
  citizen / permanent resident / green card / H-1B / TN / OPT / F-1 / study and
  work permits / "authorized to work in X [and Y]" / bare yes-no. Anything else
  abstains (blank), which is safe but may leave fields empty.
- The panel's gap list still shows abstained fields as unanswered, which is
  intended, but I did not review the panel UX visually.
- **Misses the held-out pages showed (blank, never wrong; not fixed):** Ashby's
  education Start/End month-year selects and "Still Student?"; Gecko's Ashby
  location combobox (filled on the other Ashby pages); Workable TSA's
  city/postcode/country sub-fields; "Based in Austin, TX?" (should be NO for a
  Toronto applicant); graduation-range options ("January - June 2027") could be
  matched when the profile has a month (it usually has only the year).
- **Known intermittent (not fixed):** Greenhouse's async School react-select
  (ZipRecruiter, Robinhood) sometimes ignores the extension's interaction in
  combined runs, about 1 in 5 ("Couldn't open the dropdown"): the field stays
  blank, never wrong. Run alone it filled 8/8. A probe WITHOUT the extension
  hit the same thing once in 13 tries (the widget sent no search request at
  all), so it looks like page readiness, not matching. No reliable repro, so no
  fix I could verify.
- **Partial answers (right but incomplete):** "Where do you live? (City and
  State/Province)" gets "Toronto" (no province); a graduation asked as "(Term &
  Year)" gets "2027".

**Housekeeping**
- Live e2e cases use real postings that will expire. Re-capture with
  `node test/e2e/capture.mjs` (edit `TARGETS`) and update `cases/real-live*.mjs`.
- HAR recordings of every captured page (203 MB, full-fidelity offline replay)
  are in `chrome-extension/test/e2e/results/har/` (gitignored, local only).
- The result JSON/text of every run quoted in section 4 is in
  `chrome-extension/test/e2e/results/` (gitignored): `final5-all` (final, 64
  cases), `final3-all` (with live SmartRecruiters), `heldout-1` and
  `heldout2-1` (the two blind held-out passes), `baseline-rescored` (b9aebcc on the same cases),
  `baseline-live` (first measurement), `round3-live`, `round4-live`.
- Nothing was pushed, deployed, or sent anywhere. The only network writes were
  to the local fake backend.
