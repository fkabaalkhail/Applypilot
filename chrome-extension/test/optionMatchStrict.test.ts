/**
 * Regression tests for option matching: a choice control gets one of its REAL
 * options, and only when the match is confident. "The closest-looking option"
 * is not an answer: when two options fit equally, or the only fit contradicts
 * the answer's yes/no polarity, the field is left blank.
 *
 * Bugs pinned here (2026-10-03 overnight run):
 *  - token overlap ignored negation: "I am not a protected veteran" scored 100%
 *    on BOTH "I am a protected veteran" and "I am not a veteran", so option
 *    ORDER decided the answer (the in-page harness showed the tie).
 *  - the multi-word substring tier matched characters inside words: "no" is
 *    inside "I do NOt know", so an "I do not know" answer selected "No".
 *  - ties were broken by option order instead of being refused.
 *  - a non-yes/no value could land on a yes/no choice through a shared word
 *    ("Quebec" → "Yes, I live in Quebec").
