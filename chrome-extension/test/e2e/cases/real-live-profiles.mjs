 *    STATES "Yes" to sponsorship, has a date of birth, a finished MS.
 *    US authorization stays BLANK (an F-1's authorization is restricted, not
 *    a yes/no the profile settles); sponsorship is Yes; "live in the US" Yes.
 *  - ADDRESS_ONLY: everything in one street line, "1055 W Georgia St,
 *    Vancouver, BC V6E 3P3, Canada"; split into Address / City / Postal Code.
