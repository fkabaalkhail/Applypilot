/**
 * HELD-OUT live pages (round 1 below; round 2 at the end). Round 1: twelve
 * postings drawn at random (md5 order) from prod
 * `scraped_jobs` on 2026-10-03, AFTER the night's fixes, excluding every
 * company already in the corpus. The first run was blind (no expectations,
 * every write reviewed by hand); it found five wrong writes, now fixed and
 * pinned here:
 *
 *  - Ramp (Ashby): graduation year typed into a date picker → "12/31/2026"
 *  - Superhuman (Ashby), ZipRecruiter (Greenhouse): a bare year "2027" picked
 *    one of two options it fits
 *  - Twitch, Astranis (Greenhouse): the education row's start/end dates got
 *    the first JOB's dates
 *  - Astranis (Greenhouse): "Mechanical Engineering" for a Mechatronics student
 *  - Palantir (Lever): "High School Name" / its year got the university's
 *
 * `{ oneOf: [answer, ""] }` marks a field where blank is a miss, not a wrong
 * write (an answer the profile settles but the fill may not reach), so the
 * case pins "never a different value" without being flaky.
