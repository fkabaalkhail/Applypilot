 * DEFAULT ANSWERS: screening questions no profile fact settles, but that a

 *
 * The working assumption is an applicant who ACCEPTS the posting's standard
 * terms (they are applying to it) and is UNENCUMBERED (no prior application,
 * no relative inside, no conflict, no non-compete). Every rule names that
 * assumption in its `rule` id, so telemetry and the review panel show which
 * answer came from a default rather than from the profile.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT defaulted, because a wrong answer there is a false
 * statement with consequences: work authorization, sponsorship, citizenship
 * and export-control status (profile facts only, see questionResolver),
 * criminal history, and anything asking for a fact (dates, numbers, names).
 * Marketing / SMS / newsletter opt-ins are answered NO.
