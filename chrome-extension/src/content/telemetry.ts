/**
 * Autofill telemetry: build a per-fill summary from the combined pass
 * reports/outcomes so the backend can see which sites and fields the filler
 * struggles with. This is the signal that tells us where a server-side override
 * rule is worth authoring (see api/autofill overrides).
 *
 * It now records SUCCESSES as well as failures, and it diffs what was written
 * against what the page holds afterwards.
 *
 * Why: recording only failures made one whole bug class unobservable by
 * construction, a field answered wrongly but written successfully produced a
 * `filled` count and nothing else, so the record of the page said everything
 * went well. That is exactly the bug we keep hitting ("reported filled,
 * actually wasn't" / "filled with the wrong value"), and it was the one thing
 * the data could never show.
 *
 * The re-scan diff is the second half. Per-write verification (writeEngine)
 * proves the commit stuck AT WRITE TIME. A framework can still revert a value
 * on blur, on validation, or on a re-render that a LATER field triggered, none
 * of which a per-write check can see, because by then it has moved on.
 *
 * Privacy: the DEFAULT record emits field LABELS, categories, provenance and
 * booleans only, never the user's answer values. `observedValuePresent` is a
 * boolean for that reason, "this control holds something" is the observation,
 * not what it holds. That is what every account sends.
 *
 * Diagnostic capture (`TelemetryInputs.capture`) is the deliberate exception: an
 * account that turns it ON also sends answers and sanitised employer markup, so
 * that a form which failed can be rebuilt as a fixture without visiting the live
 * site. It is opt-in, per account, and off unless the backend says otherwise,
 * so the paragraph above stays true for everybody who did not ask for it.
 *
 * Pure: host/url/observations are passed in, so it unit-tests without a
 * document.
