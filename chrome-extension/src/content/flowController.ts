/**
 * Multi-page autofill flow: fill → advance → fill → … → done/paused/stopped.
 *
 * Pure orchestration over injected deps, no chrome.*, no direct DOM writes,
 * so the whole machine unit-tests with scripted fakes. contentScript provides
 * the real deps (fillOnce, scanner snapshots, advance discovery, background
 * state persistence) and the overlay renders the progress beats.
 *
 * One Autofill click carries the whole application: a page that fills
 * cleanly counts down on the panel's bottom button (AUTO_ADVANCE_MS) and then
 * turns itself, the account wall included. The user can press the button to
 * go at once, or hold the page (Pause, or typing/clicking in it while the
 * countdown runs). A page with a required field still empty waits for the user.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *  - NEVER clicks a terminal (submit-like) button, finishes "done" instead.
 *  - Persists FlowState BEFORE clicking advance, so a real navigation (content
 *    script death) resumes on the next page via the session flag.
 *  - Never clicks an advance found on a page that has since been replaced: a
 *    page the user turned themselves is filled, not skipped.
 *  - Every pause auto-resumes when its condition clears (polled).
 *  - Runaway guards: MAX_STEPS, FLOW_TTL_MS, and a same-signature loop check.
