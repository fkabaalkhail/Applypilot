 * Field classification engine.

 * Scores every text signal of a control (label, aria-label, placeholder,

 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - Signals are weighted by reliability: a real <label> beats an id attribute,
 *    which beats loose nearby text.
 *  - Negative patterns veto a signal for a category ("Email address" must not
 *    classify as location just because it contains "address").
 *  - Corroboration across multiple signals adds a small bonus.
 *  - Anything under MIN_CATEGORY_CONFIDENCE is reported as "unknown" rather
 *    than guessed, low-confidence guesses are surfaced for review, not filled.
